  <h2><a id="18"></a>2.12. So why don't you use the LGPL?</h2>
<p>Given
<a href="harbour17.html#HarbourException">the above</a> it might be reasonable to
ask why the Harbour developers didn't elect to use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL</a> instead. The
reason simply comes down to the requirements of the LGPL and what can be
reasonably asked of anyone who wishes to make use of Harbour.</p>
<p>The LGPL requires that any binary distribution of the LGPLd code (in other
words, an application compiled with Harbour and linked against the HVM and
RTL) should be distributed in a method that allows the user to re-link the
application against different and/or later copies of the code under the
LGPL. This is an unreasonable and unworkable requirement as far as the
Harbour developers are concerned.</p>
<p>For the most part it would be fine on platforms where an application can be
linked against a dynamic version of the HVM and RTL, but any platform that
doesn't support dynamic linking (PC/MS/DR/Open/Free-DOS for example) would
be effectively shut out of Harbour usage. The Harbour developers consider
this to be a reduction of freedom and this isn't acceptable for free
software.</p>
