  <h2><a name="13"></a>2.7. What is &quot;free software&quot;?<a name="FreeSoftware"></a></h2>
<p>In general terms free software is one phrase for describing software that
comes with certain freedoms, the free doesn't speak about the price, it
speaks about your freedoms to use the software. A common suggestion is that
you think &quot;free speech&quot; instead of &quot;free beer&quot;.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a> for the Free
Software Foundation's definition of &quot;free software&quot;.</p>
<p>A related term is OpenSource, you can find out more about the idea of
OpenSource at <a href="https://www.opensource.org/">https://www.opensource.org/</a>. You might also
want to note that the FSF don't consider OpenSource and Free Software to be
the same thing, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html</a> for more
details.</p>
