Did exactly the same as above and got:

I think Harbour.exe is not being run before gcc.exe.

Hi Pritpal,
I did a new install and cannot reproduce this problem
on my system.

Anyone else with similar issue? Could you try with -trace option?

Brgds,
Viktor

Speedtest CLIPPER vs. xHarbour - COMMIT

Is CLIPPER still faster in database management?

I am testing the COMMIT statement.
With Clipper the operation takes 9 sec. with xHarbour 77 sec
function main()
local I:=0
msginfo("Start " + str( seconds() ))
use clientes new
for I := 1 to 1000
append blank
clientes->nombre := str(recno())
commit
next
msginfo("End " + str( seconds()) )

I don't know the exact answer, but issuing a dbCommit() in a loop was
already a performance killer even in Clipper.

Sorry for newbie questions.
How do I add another directory to search Libs hbmk2 for gcc?
gcc ... -LD:/Qt/harbour/lib and -LD:/Qt/2009.01/qt/lib ...

Another topic
In contrib/hbwin/wapi_commctrl.c line 784 .-
   hwnd    = ( HWND ) hb_parnint( 1 );
It should be .-
   hwnd    = wapi_par_HWND( 1 );
to avoid gcc warning.

In the past at least five times I was answering for similar questions.
I hope this is the last time. What commit() does is quite well documented
in Clipper. I suggest to read also COMIX documentation and check what
cmxSys( 1002 ) does.
I think it's a basic information which should be well known by anyone
who is working with Clipper.

dbCommit() make two things:
   1. write application memory buffers to file.
   2. send to OS request to flush disk buffers releated to open file.

The 1-st action is executed also by any other rdd operation which
may cause record reloading or may need to synchronize modifications,
f.e. unlock. You can simulate it in many different ways, f.e. by skip(0).

The 2-nd action is unique to dbcommit and it's not necessary for any
synchronizations in simultaneous/concurrent/network access. The whole
job here is sending information to Operating System which is automatically
redirected if necessary by OS to File Server that we ask to flush OS or
FS disk I/O write buffers physically to disk. OS / FS can ignore our request,
can execute it immediately or can only mark that it should be done
in some nearest future. It's in practice out of programmer control and
does not have to be.
In [x]Harbour you can disable this part of dbCommit() by:
   set( _SET_HARDCOMMIT, .F. )
In COMIX by:
   cmxSys( 1002, .f. )
As I said it does not cause any interactions to concurrent access.
Try to add set( _SET_HARDCOMMIT, .F. ) to above code and check the results.
Then write a message to your OS / network client / file server authors
and ask why COMMIT request executed from DOS application makes sth different
then executed from real Windows application. Of course if you need such
information. Probably DOS emulation layer buffers few commit requests in
some short time period, f.e. 1 sec. and then send them as one. But I only
guess. Anyhow it's not Harbour problem. Harbour only sends commit request
for open file handle to the OS and this is single function call inside
each user dbCommit() if _SET_HARDCOMMIT is not disabled. All time overhead
if any is out of Harbour code.

Very nice. Looks that using Harbour in Windows begins to be as simple
as in *nixes ;-). Thank you very much.
I have one request here. Please add to hbmk2 support for detecting
CLIPPER and RTLINK as base names and switch to -hbcmp/-hblnk mode
automatically plus add support for rtlink @file.lnk in such link mode.
It should greatly help existing Clipper users to make some tests
with Harbour. F.e. it will be enough to make:
   copy hbmk2.exe clipper.exe
   copy hbmk2.exe rtlink.exe
and make tests using existing Clipper build scripts, f.e. with rmake.exe
Of course if user does not use any 3-rd party libraries.
>From .lnk file important is only list of files after FILE directive
but we can add also support for LIB parsing and some basic translation
for used lib names. AFAIR other directives can be ignored. Such parser
can be implemented as separated single function and probably can be used
also for BLINKER .lnk files.

The whole distro is rather huge though it should not be big problem
for normal usage. But if we have support for above CLIPPER/RTLINK
emulation then we should think also about creating some minimal
Harbour distribution with some small C compiler (f.e. POCC) for
x86@32 only as startup and for Clipper users who want to make some
tests with Harbour.

Possible, because HB_DIR_IMPLIB was changed to
HB_BUILD_IMPLIB a few weeks ago. See INSTALL and ChangeLog.

You've redefined a public Harbour functions in your program.
You can ignore the message probably. For some reason I don't
get this warning when doing the same here. I've was testing with
the embedded MinGW.

using HB_DIR_ADS=/c/devl/acesdk
and if i not read
using HB_BUILD_IMPLIB .or. HB_DIR_IMPLIB=yes

I've added clipper/rtlink recognition, but I miss the .lnk parser
code, and to be frank I don't really know its exact details (used
to use "FI hello1, hello2"), so if you happen to have some/any
piece of such parser code I'll can tackle it to hbmk2.


> The whole distro is rather huge though it should not be big problem

Yes, it's not small. For me it's a problem only because it's a very heavy
job to update them, takes hours to be assembled / uploaded even without
counting the build-times themselves. Anyhow, it's well suited for final
releases, because we don't have that many of those anyway, and target
builds have to be generated anyway. So it's much better than current
dozen of harbour-1.1-win-*.zip files.

I did a quick test with a 'lite' package and the .7z file is 17MB (same is
the install .exe), installed size 117MB. This contains MinGW libs
and also MinGW x86 embedded version. POCC has a few problems, so
I'm not really interested in investing more time in it, it's slower, has
bugs,
bad 3rd party support (not QT support f.e.), and also needs special
environment
setup to make its compiler work, MinGW looks superior choice from all
aspects besides distro size.

BTW, for comparison a pure POCC build with POCC included has a 12MB
installer and installed size is 77MB. 5MB dl and 40MB installed overhead
is well worth being on the standard path with a heavy duty, standard tool
like MinGW/GCC IMO.

So ideally we should distribute these Windows files on sf.net:
- harbour-1.1.0-win.exe
- harbour-1.1.0-win.7z
- harbour-1.1.0-win-mingw.exe (aka 'lite' or 'minimal')
- harbour-1.1.0-win-mingw.7z (aka 'lite' or 'minimal')
- harbour-1.1.0-src.zip

How to name it? mingw / minimal / light / lite?

Brgds,
Viktor

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added clipper/rtlink/exospace/blinker self-name recognition.
      clipper will switch it to hbcmp mode,
      rtlink/exospace/blinker will switch it to hblnk mode.
      rtlink parameter recognition is yet to be done.

I mean no <set HB_*> settings. Am I right ? If yes, then 
this installer does not work. But if I invoke console which 
I use to build Harbour on MinGW, and then issue commands
as above, it works.

Probably on your system you test the same way so the 
problem is not reproduced. Try with a new console without
having any Harbour env setting.

You're right, nevertheless it works here and I have no such
envvars setup locally, in fact I never had any of those. Question
why it doesn't work on your system.

Could you post the difference?

Locally I store no permanent Harbour setting in my environment,
nor any C or Harbour compiler is setup in my default PATH since
at least 10 years.

I'm working with a heavily multicompiler setup here, so such
settings were killed long ago here, rest assured.

To double check, I've tested it in my XP x64 VM, which doesn't
have *anything* installed on it, plain default setup, and it also
worked as "advertized".

Please post your -trace output and above mentioned environment
difference (or both 'set' outputs). I wonder what makes hbmk2
confused on your system.

Brgds,
Viktor

I guess you meant ace32.a.

HB_BUILD_IMPLIB / HB_DIR_* isn't supported for MinGW.
Normally it isn't needed either, since you can specify
the .dll directly to the MinGW linker.

I'm checking how to add support for passing such .dlls directly
to MinGW via hbmk2. If anyone has more information on this,
it would be great, since I didn't do any extensive tests with this
scenario (nor do I need it in real life).

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Pritpal,
I have tested shared version with mingw build.
It works well and very interesting.
Thank to you and to Marcos for your great effort!
And thanks also to Viktor for hbmk2 and mingw support.

Best Regards,
Francesco

Yes, I prefer this whereever possible. In your example you
should use '-lrddads' to be compiler neutral. With ace32,
we will see, I think MinGW should find the lib by using -lace32,
given that ace32.dll is placed in the lib path. But for me it then
complains about all missing symbols, so in the case of ace32,
something more needs to be done.

Please try to get information from the internet or from Advantage,
as I won't be able to deal with this (I'm no ace32 user). If
something useful can be done with this in hbmk2, I'll try to
to implement it.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thanks. I suspect you have a CLIPPER or HARBOUR envvar set to
some (invalid to Harbour?) settings. I'm thinking this because by default
hbmk2 should call harbour.exe without -q/-q0, while in your case
Harbour is called with that since the logo header is missing from the
output.

Can you check this?

PS : I do not see the hello.c after above execution, which must be there

It should be deleted in this case.

Message-ID: <22829528.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

Can someone look into or point to some useful hints:

I am trying to compile QAxBase class and recieve this error

c:/qt/2009.01/qt/include/ActiveQt/../../src/activeqt/container/qaxbase.h:55:
error: `QtValidLicenseForActiveQtModule' does not name a type

If I comment out in c:/qt/2009.01/qt/src/activeqt/container/qaxbase.h 
line#55
which reads as 

QT_MODULE(ActiveQt)

Class compiles fine. But I do not know the future issues.
Can someone point to a solution without touching QT sources?

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

Hi Pritpal,

look at:
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/activeqt.html#activeqt

"The ActiveQt modules are part of the Qt Full Framework Edition. They 
are not part of the Open Source Versions of Qt."

:-(

Best regards,
Francesco

Seem that ActiveQt is only for windows and only for commercial license.
Is the only qt part in this situation?

This discussion is from Qt newsgroups:

From: "Benjamin Parzella" <bparzella@spa.de>
Newsgroups: trolltech.qt-interest
Subject: [Qt-interest] License ActiveQt Open Source 4.5
Date: Thu, 5 Mar 2009 09:16:10 +0100

Hello,

I noticed that the Open Source version of Qt 4.5 contains the source 
code of the ActiveQt components. Trying to build it with qmake gives me 
the error

Project MESSAGE: You are not licensed to use ActiveQt.

But the header and source files state that they are licensed under the 
BSD license, which allows the usage in commercial closed source 
applications without publishing the source code.
Does that mean I can use ActiveQt in my closed source application by 
building it myself (e.g. with a custom project file), or are there any 
other restrictions I missed?

I want to create an ActiveX component with ActiveQt and the LGPL Version 
of Qt 4.5.

Thanks,
Benjamin

ActiveQt is BSD licensed, that's correct. So you're allowed to use it in
an open source or closed source application.

However, we have not yet modified the buildsystem to support that. So,
you'll have to make those modifications yourself for the time being.

Message-ID: <18d502870904010938n282bc69sdb49ac658108f2b0@mail.gmail.com>

It worked for me after massaging it a bit:---
set PATH=%~dp0
pexports ace32.dll > ace32.def
dlltool -d ace32.def -D ace32.dll -k -l libace32.a
---

The ugly PATH trick is needed because dlltool tries to
run 'as' tool and it only finds it if in PATH, even if they are
in the same and current dir :)

The other ugly bit is that pexports is missing from
several MinGW distros, notably the latest ones, which
are unofficial.

So, for now this routine will have to be done by
users locally.

The third bit is that I didn't manage to use libace32.a
to actually link a Harbour executable. [ Same missing
symbols. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

You are right.
I was invoking it from console which I use to compile Clipper applns.
With new cmd.exe console it works as described.

Thanks for this very handy tool.

Please outline how can I compile .lib hbmk2 and then join 
so produced libs and more prg to final .exe. Asking just not 
to spend more time to figure out how.

I would like to transfer my projects to hbmk2 to start with.
Also I am thinking of invoking hbmk2 through xMate, and if I could, 
then we have a killer build environment.  For sure it would been 
easy but I am not able to contact to Andy Wos. Andy ?

ace32.dll ver 9 is able to connect only a v9 server and superior if any

ace32.dll ver 7 is able to connect only to a v7 server and superio
ace32.dll ver 6 is able to connect only ti a v6 server and superior
So if you have a customer with 6 one with 9 ,ecc you must generate multiple

or be limited to v6 feature
particularry v9 allow Visual Fox Pro format and will be usefull integrate it

Is possible generate from multiple acesdk dir?
Consider this particularry for binary distribution simple to use

More from ActiveQt:

Congratulations! Can?t wait to try the new SDK!

I noticed that the ActiveQt sources are included in the LGPL SDK 
package. I?m not entirely sure, but I AFAIK previous Qt versions didn?t 
include them in the opensource editions. Is ActiveQt now LGPL?ed, too? 
It seems this is not the case, since the build script still checks for a 
vaild commercial license.

ActiveQt is now part of the open source package too. We didn?t fix the 
build scripts, but it?s there. Note, however, that mingw cannot compile 
it: you need Visual Studio for ActiveQt.

As for the license, it?s one of those cases where the LGPL wouldn?t work 
quite well, so we went for another: see for example qaxmain.cpp

It seems it is too much work.
So what is the simple solution to just disable it 
in Harbour builds from outside of the the QT.

One solution is just not include QAx* classes at all.
But I am looking for some #define if it could suppress 
above situation.

Thanks for the concern.

BTW how do you rate this QT implemenattion.
Goal is not to change sources in the root, instead
update source headers and <hbqtgen.prg>.
Your opinions will be valuable.

I think I cannot do more to make this easier in the scope of
Harbour. You can create a local starter script which calls the
Harbour build scripts to create just this one lib, rename it to
some versioned name, do a clean, and create another with
a different setting. Maybe some ACE user with enough interest
can create such batch file. It's certainly doable with current
infrastructure.

Brgds,
Viktor

Maybe in the next update of the Qt SDK, the things will be more easy. :-)

I am updating my Harbour installation, to test last changes.

But my opinion is that you done a great job. Auto-generated source code 
is much more easy to fix, update and maintain.

Wait more comments. :-)

I've just written such simple parser.
It does not check full syntax and try to only extract interesting parts:
file list, library list and output file name. Other commands are ignored.
It recognize comments and @included .lnk files.
It should work also with blinker .lnk scripts. I tried to merge both syntax.
I haven't made any deep analyzes of used syntax in both linkers and haven't
tried to replicate all existing and undocumented features but it should work
for valid .lnk scripts though probaly it can be confused by some extended
and not stripped commands. I was to lazy to add full list of blinker commands
to be sure they are well stripped. If user will report some problems with
example then we can update the parser if necessary.
Self contain code below. You can use it for some tests.

Below is corrected version.
I removed one redundant line I left by mistake in copy and past
and added some basic translation for well know Clipper, Blinker,
ExoSpace, SIX, Class(y) files.
For sure it does not cover all possibilities but for many users
should be enough and if they will want then can extend this list.

Q. How can an MSVC program call an MinGW DLL, and vice versa?

A. Assume we have a testdll.h, testdll.c, and testmain.c. In the first case,
we will compile testdll.c with MinGW, and let the MSVC-compiled testmain
call it. You should use

gcc -shared -o testdll.dll testdll.c \
    -Wl,--output-def,testdll.def,--out-implib,libtestdll.a

to produce the DLL and DEF files. MSVC cannot use the MinGW library, but
since you have already the DEF file you may easily produce one by the
Microsoft LIB tool:

lib /machine:i386 /def:testdll.def

Once you have testdll.lib, it is trivial to produce the executable with
MSVC:

cl testmain.c testdll.lib

Now for MinGW programs calling an MSVC DLL. We have two methods. One way is
to specify the LIB files directly on the command line *after* the main
program (in newer MinGW versions; MinGW GCC 2.95.2 is reported not to work).
For example, after

cl /LD testdll.c

use

gcc -o testmain testmain.c testdll.lib

The other way is to produce the .a files for GCC. For __cdecl functions (in
most cases), it is simple: you only need to apply the reimp tool (the
original site is unavailable now, but you may download
here<http://www.geocities.com/yongweiwu/reimp_new.zip> a
version enhanced by Jos? Fonseca):

reimp testdll.lib
gcc -o testmain testmain.c -L. -ltestdll

However, the above method does not work with __stdcall functions. For MSVC
will prefix an underscore to __stdcall functions while MinGW will not. The
right way is to produce the DEF file using the pexports tool (downloadable
here <http://www.geocities.com/yongweiwu/pexports-0.43.zip> if not found
elsewhere) and filter off the first underscore by sed:

pexports testdll.dll | sed "s/^_//" > testdll.def

Then, when using dlltool to produce the import library, add `-U' to the
command line:

dlltool -U -d testdll.def -l libtestdll.a

And now, you can proceed in the usual way:

gcc -o testmain testmain.c -L. -ltestdll

Hooray, we got it. And that is the end of this FAQ.

Hi All

There is a construct in prototypes as 

QFontInfo ( const QFont & font )

What way we can translate <const QFont & font> in Harbour.
Note : on prg level <QFont> is available as a pointer as QFont* font.

I am struck with this type as I do not know hoe to resolve.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

I finally did some research to find out what on earth %~dp0 does. Nice.

You may not know about setlocal and endlocal, which are handy. I do not know 
which versions of cmd support it, certainly XP and later.

mingw build needs msys, while msvc uses plain cmd.
mingw can also be run using plain cmd, but you'll lose
postinst.sh (plus the process is not very well tested and
also slower).

In the first example you seem to try building mingw
using cmd (make_gnu.bat), that's why postinst.sh isn't
run. In the second example it's run through msys
(make_gnu.sh), which is the right way.

At least that's my best guess.

[ BTW, here it runs using my usual little script, which
is the same as the example now included in INSTALL.
Check EXAMPLES section. ]

Sometimes I'm thinking on allowing cmd builds for
mingw, but it will be again a double effort and increases
variations, so instead I'll just add a check to make_gnu.bat
to redirect users to the msys path. msys/bash is needed
anyway for MinGW cross builds, so we cannot remove it.

Brgds,
Viktor

It isn't the supported way, your build will be incomplete.
Currently the Harbour .dlls will be missing.

I don't know why you're getting a warning, I've fixed that
yesterday and I'm not getting it with 4.3.3. What is the exact
message you're getting now?

I'll check what it takes to add .dll support in postinst.bat.

Brgds,
Viktor

Viktor,

> Currently the Harbour .dlls will be missing.
Ops... You're right, I not have dlls but otherwise works well and is more practical to me.
With the recent changes I can not do this. I get the message .-
For mingw builds, use 'sh make_gnu.sh'. See INSTALL for more.
	
IMO: I prefer as it was before.

Hi!

  * bin/hb-mkdyn.bat
  * bin/postinst.bat
    + Added support for GCC family .dll creation. (Cygwin not tested)
      This will also create .def files. Also implib .a files are possible,
      code is there commented.
    + Added 'wce' ARCH support.
    ! Fixed to not include gtwin in WinCE .dlls.
    + Added support for HB_DLLIBS envvar.
    ; NOTE: The benefits of using cmd shell instead of msys to create
            mingw builds is that hbrun-dll and hbtest-dll are also
            created and you don't have use forward slashes in HB_INC_*
            envvars. It also allows to more easily add implib creation
            in the future. Overall the Windows build environment is
            more uniform this way. msys build output though is much
            sleeker and also seems faster.
            If this method turns out to be okay, it may become the
            default/support/standard way to build Harbour with MinGW
            on Windows. (if not we can return to the msys method)

    ; TOFIX: Shared MinGW executables cannot be built if Harbour was built
             with -DHB_DYNLIB. IMO this macro should be ignored in MinGW
             builds as there is no separate DLL build and non-DLL.
             [ I cannot fix this. ]
             Until then I had to a hack to starter batch files.

  * mpkg_win.bat
    * Switched to use make_gnu.bat instead of make_gnu.sh to build
      GCC family targets.

  * make_gnu.bat
    + Added special codepath for GCC familty as it needs one pass only
      to create .dlls.

  * INSTALL
    * Updated to reflect now possible non-msys MinGW build.
    * Updated example to use non-msys flavours.
    + Readded MinGW + msys example.
    % Minor simplification in mingw64/mingwce targets.
      (HB_CCPATH no longer needed on Windows)

my fault, I have posted wrong log file but also mixed commands.
Now I did it again, but the result is that build process completes and 
libs are not imported.
In particular bgd.lib that I'm using to build uhttpd gd version is 
missing (see below).

I'm using msys + mingw to build SVN and I have scripts too, see attached 
files, I hope that are correct. (BTW the msys example you wrote in 
INSTALL uses % instead of $ in var names, I suppose that are wrong ;-) )

I'm puzzling because yesterday it works correctly, unless I did 
something different, but I remember not.

Best regards,
Francesco

Which OS and compiler?
In the function hb_cmdargUpdate() there are two branches: for HB_OS_WIN
and for the rest.

I can't tell anything about the non-win branch, but the win version call
GetModuleFileName( NULL, s_lpAppName, MAX_PATH )
When the first parameter is NULL the function will return the EXE name
that called the DLL, if you pass the DLL hinst - you'll get the name of
the DLL itself.

What are the expected results and what does your friend get?

In mingw mode there are no implibs generated, this functionality
was never implemented.

I'll make this also explicit in docs.

Probably it can be added but I have no idea of the rules and
by default MinGW can directly use .dlls, so implib is only needed
where this fails (like ACE32, and who know what else).

No, these are native starter .bat scripts. The bash part kicks
in the last line: 'sh make_gnu.sh'. All initialization is done in classic
batch.

I though this is apparent from the code ('set' commands), but I'll
make a note of this in INSTALL anyway.

I don't know, never tried to do the full initialization in bash.
I'd recommend to stick with EXAMPLE parts and simply use
batches for that.

You should change this:
HARBOURFLAGS -> HB_USER_PRGFLAGS

Viktor

try this.-

    QFont serifFont("Times", 10, QFont::Bold);
    QFont* font = &serifFont;	// Address of serifFont

    QFontInfo FontInf( (*font) ); // Reference of (object)

    ASSERT( FontInf.bold() );

s_argv gets initialized from hb_cmdargInit(), but when a self contained DLL 
is built and maindll.c is used, then hb_cmdargInit() is not called, and 
hb_cmdargUpdate() call from hb_vmInit() generates a GPF, as s_argv has not 
been initialized.

I do not use neither fivewin nor msvc. I hope ole library should work

No, the problem occurs when include fivewin. Some example work fine when
harbour + msvc but not (fwh + harbour + msvc). 

Any suggestions on how can I fix this?

I am not asking for how I am returned the pointer.
My question is : once I am returned a pointer how can I 
pass it back to some another function which is expecting
<const QFont & font>.

pFont := QT_QFont()  // say I am returned default font

at this point <pFont> is a pointer and not const.
Now I want to pass pFont to another function with this 
prototype : bool DoPainting( QPaintDevice * pd, const QFont & font )
Then I call:  oPD:doPainting( pFont ) 
which translates to:
hbqt_par_QPaintDevice( 1 )->doPainting( hbqt_par_QFont( 2 ) );
this gives error. 

Please note, above is an example. The point is that 
I am returned with a pointer and want to pass back as < const xx & var >.
I mean I am not finding a way to convert a pointer to a const.

Hope I am clear what I want to achieve.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

Not a 'const'. 'const' is only parameter attribute not type
which informs the compiler that given function will not change
passed value.

You have to convert it to QFont and then C++ will convert it to
QFont& following the function declaration.

Below it's self contain example which should help you in understanding
the C++ references.

If you think about it then you will find why C++ has to be such restricted
in type checking. Without it it will not be possible to compile most of code.

Przemek

  * harbour/source/rtl/dircmd.prg
    ! small fix in 'DIR <filemask>' DOS like output formatting.
      Note: this function uses strict DOS like 8.3 file name convention
            in the output so it will play well with long file names.
            Maybe we should change the output formatting?

It has cleared my doubts.
I am worndering how I could not tested it like this or what 
I was doing wrong. It is as simple as:

hbqt_par_QWebView( 1 )->setUrl( *hbqt_par_QUrl( 2 ) );

Yes, but I suggest to make it a little bit more complicated and
add at least some basic parameter validation and add RT errors
on wrong parameters before use.
Otherwise such code will GPF on NULL pointers.
Parameter validation needs some additional code but it greatly
helps in longer terms and farther developing and later library
usage by final users.

Yes. And it is a must. Not an option.
Right now  I am concentrating on valid code generation.
Once it is pefected, we can implement parameter validation too.

Another problem:

This is the prototype:
const QTransform & worldTransform () const

This should translates to ?
hb_retptr( &hbqt_par_QPainter( 1 )->worldTransform() );
But the error reported is :
C:\harbour\contrib\hbqt\gensource\hbqt_qpainter.cpp:827: error: invalid
conversion from `const void*' to `void*'

What I am missing ?
I tried hb_retptr( *hbqt_par_QPainter( 1 )->worldTransform() );   but more
errors.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

  */
HB_FUNC( QT_QFONT )
{
    if( HB_IS_STRING( 1 ) )
    {
       hb_retptr( ( QFont* ) new QFont() );
    }
    else
    {

This should be HB_ISCHAR( 1 ). I've fixed it in few places,
but there is one new such call in SVN again now. Pbly
the generator should be changed.

Hi Harbour Team!

Mayby You add "Alias Symbol" like:
SETALIAS VariableWithLongName FOR VariableWi
SETALIAS FunctionWithLongName() FOR  FunctionWi()
SETSHORTALIAS VariableWithLongName , FunctionWithLongName() //auto set alias
for 10 lenght original

Now, VariableWithLongName and VariableWi on the same variable,
FunctionWithLongName() and FunctionWi() on the same function.

Try this.-

hb_retptr( &( (QTransform& )(hbqt_par_QPainter( 1 )->worldTransform()) ) );

This is correct.

No, never. I just could not get everything.
I am from Clipper roots basically so find difficult
to follow C syntax, and yet this is C++ syntax.

Fixed in QFont.qth.
Anything fixed must be in /qth/Q*.qth. Sources will ever be 
generated auto and any fix there will be lost.

I am reviewing and reworking on new look .qth so please
defer any fix there. Just report it on this list.

It's a problem. Probably I can hack some extension to DBF* RDDs
and dynamically updated long field names if they refer to current
WA fields but in longer terms such hacks create problems when
user really want to use long symbols so such feature will have
to be enabled optionally only on user request by some RDDI_*
action, f.e.:
   rddInfo( RDDI_FNAMETRANS, .t., "DBFCDX" )

It does not resolve the problem because you will have to add many
different aliases for the same name with 10, 11, 12, ... characters.
People have a lot of typos in source code after 10-th character.
Static compile time aliassing does not resolve the problem with macro
compiler so such feature have to be implemented at runtime otherwise
people will still finding some problems and we only make it harder
to locate and fix.
Only global reducing to 10 significant characters resolve the problem
but this is very serious limitation.
So the final answer has to be: clean the code to use exact names.
The exception is RDD subsystem and field names. Here different RDDs
has different field name size limits and different restrictions to
supported field names.
F.e. even in Clipper you can use as field name: "A+B" but later you
will not be able to access it directly and you will have to use
fieldpos()/fieldget()/fieldput(). Some RDDs allow to use spaces in
field names, f.e. "ZIP CODE" and such fields also cannot be accessed
directly. So here some aliasing system can be interesting alternative.
But the question is how deeply we should implement it. If we do not
make original names invisible then people will still have problems
with some code like:
   for i := 1 to fcount()
      oBrw:AddColumn( TBColumnNew( FieldName( i ), ;
                                   &( "{||" + FieldName( i ) + "}" ) ) )
   next
FieldName(), dbstruct(), etc. have to return aliased names only to
compatible with macro compiler.
If we fully hide original names by aliases then we lost them in
COPY TO / APPEND FROM operations but IMHO it's the smallest cost we
have to pay in comparison to other solutions.

It's not trivial to resolve problem without introducing some other problems
or anomalies but unlike with variables and function names in RDD case we
cannot say that programmer should clean his .prg code because it may not
be enough due to field name convention which comes from some foreign
database system and is not Clipper/Harbour compatible at all.
So sooner or later we will have to think about some helper solution but
it will be local to RDD only.
Now user can create some local translation systems customized for their
own needs using USRRDD to create some simple wrappers to existing RDDs
or use fieldpos()/fieldget()/fieldput().

For memvars (public and private variables) they can make some
RT tricks like:
   proc main()
      public myvar1_localdata := "abc"
      public myvar1_loc := iif( .t., @myvar1_localdata, )

      ? myvar1_localdata, myvar1_loc
      myvar1_loc := upper( myvar1_loc )
      ? myvar1_localdata, myvar1_loc
   return

just like for functions:
   func my_longfunctionname()
      [...]

   func my_longfun()
   return my_longfunctionname()

depending on existing source code it may be enough or not.
There is still problem with Clipper code which makes things like:
   dbSelectAreaForSaleTable( 2 )
In Clipper only 10 character are significant so some people used
others as some type of comment. In such case only global cuting all
symbols to 10 characters can help. It's good if these are functions
called explicitly because they can be easy caught and fixed at compile
time but if they are used in macro compiler then compilation and linking
passes without any warnings but later they have RT errors.
Any aliasing system will help them. It's necessary to carefully
check the whole source code.

> Now, VariableWithLongName and VariableWi on the same variable,
> FunctionWithLongName() and FunctionWi() on the same function.

See above. Thanks for the suggestions but if you analyze the
problem deeply then you will find that only global symbol length
reduction to 10 characters can give full Clipper compatibility.
All other solutions only moves the problem. They can help some
people but do not some others so they are rather efficient only
as some local workarounds not as general core code feature.
For RDDs we can try to introduce some exceptions as workaround
for some different low level RDD driver field name conventions
but they should be local to given RDDs and always optional.
Just like adopting index KEY and FOR expressions to table field
names like in your example. Maybe I'll add it in some spare time
to DBF* RDDs.
In core code we probably can only add one simple feature as
DBI_* action, f.e.:
   dbInfo( DBI_SETFIELDNAME, { <nField>, <cNewFieldName> } )
so user can make some customized RDDs or simply use wrapper
to dbUseArea() which will open table (.dbf) and then some
initialization file (<table name>.ini) and set new field names
to aliases defined inside using DBI_SETFIELDNAME.

In other words, help the harbour development.
Clean old code (CLIPPER syntax) to new code style (HARBOUR)
and save developer time, that not need adding "such features" to harbour.

This takes time and can hard, but will make all happy.

Subject: [Harbour] HbQt - methods returning pointers (suggestion)
Message-ID: <49D666AC.4020007@yahoo.com.br>

Pritpal,

I have a suggestion about methods that return pointers and i would like 
to know your opinion (and the opinion of the others developers too).

While a function return a pointer, my suggestion is that methods must 
return objects and not pointers.

See this example:

Class TQMainWindow

METHOD  menuBar()                           INLINE  
Qt_QMainWindow_menuBar( ::pPtr )

The function Qt_QMainWindow_menuBar() return a pointer to a QMenuBar object.

The method TQMainWindow:menuBar() can be changed to return a object of 
the class TQMenuBar:

METHOD  menuBar()                           INLINE  
TQMenuBar():NewFromPointer( Qt_QMainWindow_menuBar( ::pPtr ) )

Method NewFromPointer (can be another name) can be implemented in 
TQObject class:

METHOD NewFromPointer (p) CLASS TQObject
   ::pointer := p
Return self

If the developer need a pointer, can use the function. Using classes, 
the developers get objects.

See this sample (adapted from my blog):

   oMainWindow:Show()

   oApplication:Exec()

========== end code ==========

No pointers in the samples. Only objects.

If you want to maintain methods returning pointers, maybe we can use a 
flag to control the value returned by methods:

METHOD  menuBar() INLINE  IIf( flag, TQMenuBar():NewFromPointer( 
Qt_QMainWindow_menuBar( ::pPtr ) ), Qt_QMainWindow_menuBar( ::pPtr ) )

When passing a object as a parameter to a function, the type of the 
parameter can be checked to see if is a object or a pointer. Something 
like this:

#define GETPOINTER(p) IIf( valtype(p)=="O", p:ptr, p )

Your point is valid. Initial I also thought of it.
But it needs updating the generated classes manually.
What I plan, and has explained earlier also ( see the changelog ),
these sources and classes thereof will become the ancestor
for higher level class framework based on Xbase++ XBPParts classes.
Goal is not to change auto generated code, instead change
derived classes.

Wait a day more. I have restructured the base sources and 
probably 97% of QT wrapper code will be able to be compiled and
working flawlessly.

Anyway on this topic, we can discuss further.

Pritpal Bedi

Where is last version of pexport?
Here for linux ver 0.44
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/fstrba/Fedora_10/repodata/repoview/pexports-0-0.44-7.1.html
Here the source
http://tml.pp.fi/pexports-0.44.zip,
But i don't find win32 compiled version



You can also use link -dump -exports instead of pexports, but then you
will have to edit the output file into .def syntax, and the exported
variables won't be marked with the DATA keyword, which probably is
very relevant for the produced import library to be useful with MSVC.

Intresting I hope that gtwvg & upcoming gt based on qt will follow the

   oAct:Do( "AttachToWindow", oWnd:hWnd )

   oRb = oAct:Do( "AddRibbonBar", "fwh" )

   oMenu = oRb:Controls:Add( 2, 0, "Menu" )

    + Enabled rtlink/blinker parsing code, so now hbmk2 will
      work as a plugin replacement for clipper, rtlink/blinker/exospace
      when renamed to these names. Example:
      ---
      > copy hbmk2.exe clipper.exe
      > copy hbmk2.exe rtlink.exe
      > clipper hello.prg
      > echo OUT myhello FI hello > rtl.lnk
      > rtlink @rtl.lnk

    ! Restructured the layout of .qth source headers.
      List of section blocks:
         <CLASS>   </CLASS>
         <CODE>    </CODE>
         <ENUMS>   </ENUMS>
         <PROTOS>  </PROTOS>
         <SLOTS>   </SLOTS>
         <SIGNALS> <SIGNALS>
      This layout will be useful for future extensions.
      We can spread anything outside of these blocks wheatever 
      is required.

      The <hbqtgen> engine has been reworked and enhanced to a 
      great extent. At this moment about 99% functions are compiled
      properly. Except for one warning everypiece compiles fine:
          : warning: taking address of temporary 
      which is the result of code like as below:
          /*
           * QIcon icon () const
           */
          HB_FUNC( QT_QABSTRACTBUTTON_ICON )
          {
             hb_retptr( &( ( QIcon ) hbqt_par_QAbstractButton( 1 )->icon() ) );
          }
      is spread all over. I have no clue how to suppress it. 
      This is why I have not posted the files in root folder.
      NOTE: Make system fails for <Makefile_gen>, Viktor?

      The demoqt.prg is updated with many features. Just play.

      And an Experiment: /tests/wvtext.prg can be updated to work with 
      QT Widgets. Though this is not the end goal of QT, you may take 
      advantage of QT's powerful yet simple classes to embed in your
      console applications.

I don't know probably something basic, please experiment
with it a little I simply cannot deal with that many details.

All WinCE builds are also broken. I don't know why.

     The demoqt.prg is updated with many features. Just play.

I'd suggest to copy it to contrib/hbqt/tests/ and modify it there.

Brgds,
Viktor

How can compile tests/wvtext.prg with qg
Normaly i compile with
hbmk2 wvtext -gui -gtwvt -mt
so i try
hbmk2 wvtext -gui -mt -Lc:\devl\Qt\2009.01\qt\lib
but i can't close demo

Follow reply in xbase++ ng separated by -----------------


------------------------------------------
This is not a GPF, but the program simply ran out of Memory, because you
were creating 2000000 or so MOM objects -- in form of (empty) arrays --
in a loop without any other code. If you put some sleep() or some other
code in this loop, so that the GC has time to kick in, then you wouldn't
get this runtime error. Anyway, its not a GPF and it has absolutely
nothing to do with multi-threading.

-- Andreas
--------------------------------------
Przemek, Massimo, Angel,

A simple proof for this, is to increase the loops to 5 Million (from
1 Million), and run it with a single thread. You will get the same
out-of-memory error.

Also, if you reduce the number of loops to 500,000, you can run two or
even three threads without any error.

I agree that this XppFatal error due to memory exhaustion should certainly
be considered a defect, and I hope it will be fixed at some time, even
though I won't hold my breath. ;-)

Is this 2M MOM limit documented anywhere? I think that Xbase++ should be
able to handle more than 800M of memory, anyway, IMNSHO.

The following, condensed, version of the program will create the same fatal
error, but it doesn't reveal any "very serious problem" with multi-threading
in Xbase++, as the original poster alleged!

Procedure Main()
LOCAL aArray, nCount, nSeconds := Seconds()
   for nCount := 1 to 2500000
       aArray := {}
   next
   QOut('Seconds: ' + alltrim(str(Seconds() - nSeconds)))
return

The following, slightly modified program will run without an error, though,
as it is about 50% slower, which gives the GC enough time to clean up, at
least on my computer!

Procedure Main()
LOCAL aArray, nCount, nSeconds := Seconds()
   for nCount := 1 to 2500000
       aArray := Array(0)
   next
   QOut('Seconds: ' + alltrim(str(Seconds() - nSeconds)))
return

A PDR or a note in the documentation would be nice, though.

It is not documented except in historical NG posts and communications I have
had with Alaska support.  My personal experience is that I rarely exceed
250K MOM objects which still has plenty of breathing room.

The 800M limit is a result of Xbase++ partitioning the 2GB address space
of a 32 bit process at startup.  It is a design decision of Alaska Software
that makes sense in light of the fact that Xbase++ uses its own heap manager
that seems to be written for a single contiguous block of memory AND 3rd
party in-process DLLs need memory space for their operation outside of the
Xbase++ heap.

FWIW, the original poster (Przemek) is a highly skilled C developer on the
harbour project who has been implementing MT in harbour using Xbase++ as
a model for compatibility.  He is the harbour counterpart to Steffen of which
I respect both of their skill sets.  However, Przemek is not an
Xbase++ expert/enthusiast
as he is committed to open source software.

It would be interesting to know if it is the Array() call processing overhead
(slow down), the Array() call (entry/exit code), or the actual Array()
implementation
that allows/causes the GC to catch up.

It is not documented except in historical NG posts and communications I have
had with Alaska support.  My personal experience is that I rarely exceed
250K MOM objects which still has plenty of breathing room.

The 800M limit is a result of Xbase++ partitioning the 2GB address space
of a 32 bit process at startup.  It is a design decision of Alaska Software
that makes sense in light of the fact that Xbase++ uses its own heap manager
that seems to be written for a single contiguous block of memory AND 3rd
party in-process DLLs need memory space for their operation outside of the
Xbase++ heap.

FWIW, the original poster (Przemek) is a highly skilled C developer on the
harbour project who has been implementing MT in harbour using Xbase++ as
a model for compatibility.  He is the harbour counterpart to Steffen of which
I respect both of their skill sets.  However, Przemek is not an
Xbase++ expert/enthusiast
as he is committed to open source software.

Hi,

I have testet the code on 2 PCs:

[b]No Errors here ![/b]

PCs:
PC1: AMD Athlon 64 3000++ (1800 Mhz), 1GB Ram, Win2000 SP4
PC2: AMD Athlon X2 4200++ (2200 Mhz), 2GB Ram, WinXP SP3
Compiler:
XPP 1.82.294
XPP 1.90.331
XPP 1.90.350

The results are very close together, but not in this test:

PC1-1.82.294:
   [ T042: iif( i%1000==0, a:={}, ), aadd(a,{i,1,.t.,s,s2,a2, ]...39.84
PC1-1.90.331:
   [ T042: iif( i%1000==0, a:={}, ), aadd(a,{i,1,.t.,s,s2,a2, ]....6.43
PC1-1.90.350:
   [ T042: iif( i%1000==0, a:={}, ), aadd(a,{i,1,.t.,s,s2,a2, ]....6.53
     // Beta

PC2-1.82.294:
   [ T042: iif( i%1000==0, a:={}, ), aadd(a,{i,1,.t.,s,s2,a2, ]...66.73
PC2-1.90.331:
   [ T042: iif( i%1000==0, a:={}, ), aadd(a,{i,1,.t.,s,s2,a2, ]....6.11
PC2-1.90.350:
   [ T042: iif( i%1000==0, a:={}, ), aadd(a,{i,1,.t.,s,s2,a2, ]....6.13
     // Beta

I think the SL1-RC1 will be a little faster after Release,
but maybe the little difference is caused by other tasks.
I did not change the 1-CPU setting, just compiled it as it is.

I think that the speed increase is caused of the internal use of LONG
vars if a integer value is detected. But I can't know it.

There was no problem to run the test here !

Bye
Hubert

Subject: [Harbour] hbmk2: little bug and ask for a new feature ...
Message-ID: <49D8D6E2.3030307@teledetection.fr>

Hi,

- I notice a little bug with hbmk2 (debian lenny 5.0 - harbour svn 10781):

$ echo '? "hello"' > t.prg
$ hbmk2 t
hbmk: Processing configuration: /usr/bin/hbmk.cfg
Harbour 1.1.0dev (Rev. 10781)
Copyright (c) 1999-2009, http://www.harbour-project.org/
Compiling 't.prg'...
Lines 1, Functions/Procedures 1
Generating C source output to 't.c'... Done.
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -llibharbour
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
hbmk: Error: Running C compiler. 256:

-L/usr/lib/harbour -Wl,--start-group -llibharbour -lhbcplr -lhbdebug 
-Wl,--end-group


notice : -llibharbour
i suppose it must be -lharbour  ?

- Is-it possible to run hbmk2 *without executing anything*, only 
displaying the command lines ?

I think this feature would be very usefull.

- In the INSTALL file we can have the debian way (ubuntu,...) to install 
harbour :

-------
$ fakeroot sh mpkg_deb.sh
$ sudo dpkg -i ../harbour_1.*.deb

To test it type:
$ echo '? "Hello world!"' > hello.prg
$ ./hello
You should see 'Hello world!' on screen.
--------

we should add also the rpm way ...

Thanks,

Guy

Massimo

You know what is the problem with you ?
You never read the messages and changelog at all.
Don't expect that we are here to teach you every bit.

PROGNOSIS:
           - Stay in harbour/contrib/hbqt/generator
           - hbmk2.exe hbqtgen
           - del ..\gensource\*.*
           - del ..\doc\*.*
           - hbqtgen.exe qt45.qtp
           - cd ..
           - you should be staying at harbour/contrib/hbqt
           - del *.* ( be careful that you are under the right folder )
           - copy gensource/*.*
           - invoke QT specific build batch
           - cd tests
           - hbmk2.exe demoqt
           - demoqt.exe
           - .
           - play with gadgets

I am using a HWGUI library to embed ActiveX controls. It calls 
hb_oleVariantToItem and since it is declared static in olecore.c I get a linker 
error:

hbactivex.lib(c_activex.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol 
_hb_oleVariantToItem referenced in function _Invoke@36

I guess the above change would fix this problem.

I do see that it may cause trouble for wvgsink.c which I guess is using 
win_ole.c to for the declaration. I guess that is deprecated in view of 
Mindaugas' rewrite?

Toninho, how did you resolve your problem?

Alex

Hi Alex

>Toninho, how did you resolve your problem?

No, I?m using old winole that have support for numeric handle in
new(hobj).

To support FWH/HWGUI/MiniGui the new OLE need support it, but to have:

---cut---
METHOD New( uObj, cClass, cLicense ) CLASS TOleAuto
...
   ELSEIF ISNUMBER( uObj )
      OleAddRef( uObj )
      ::hObj := uObj
---cut---

we need support HB_IT_ARRAY in hb_oleItemToVariant().

Mindaugas, can you please help us ?

Regards,

Toninho.

You know what is the problem with you ?
You never read the messages and changelog at all.
Don't expect that we are here to teach you every bit.

PROGNOSIS:
          - Stay in harbour/contrib/hbqt/generator
          - hbmk2.exe hbqtgen
          - del ..\gensource\*.*
          - del ..\doc\*.*

          - copy gensource/*.*

Package creation isn't in the scope of INSTALL, as I intentionally
didn't want to complicate things with it (package creation isn't
a requirement to create a usable *nix build). We should have
another document describing package creation related topics.
But, probably someone else will be a better candidate to give details
on these, as I don't use them, and I don't understand how they work
or why they work the way they do on different situations and distros.

Otherwise it'd be good to have such doc to clear up any question
regarding all the pkg creation variations we have.

Brgds,
Viktor

There is no make_vc.bat in the nightly .zip file. Please start over with
a fresh directory, and make sure to read INSTALL about updated build
instructions, you probably try to use the old non-GNU make system,
which no more exists.

I've added it, with the difference that it will return void, as HRESULT doesn't
seem to have any reasonable meaning in this context.

Thank you, but ...

I have (as I often do) got the problem wrong, I am not even using the new 
library. hb_oleVariantToItem is not visible in hbwin.lib.

Looking with DUMPBIN.EXE I see in the lib a decorated name:

         3 ?hb_oleVariantToItem@@YAJPAU_HB_ITEM@@PAUtagVARIANT@@@Z

So I guess perhaps it was compiled in C++ mode or something?

I will mess around with this as best I can, but if you know what I should do I 
would appreciate it. I compiled Harbour with MSVC 9 and these env variables set:

set HB_ARCHITECTURE=win
set HB_COMPILER=msvc
set HB_GT_LIB=gtwin
set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=\users\alex\harbour-1.1.0

Regards and thanks
Alex

Hi Alex,
I don't know about hbwin's OLE implementation, I thought we're talking about
new one.
In the old, it's missing/wrong extern declaration (in non-hbwin code,
because this function
was never officially made public by us), which makes caller incompatible
with now default
C++ mode in msvc. Anyhow I wouldn't like to spend any more time on the old
code,
as I hope the new one will replace it rather sooner than later.
Please try to test the new one.

HB_GT_LIB doesn't exist anymore, use this line if you absolutely need to
change the
build default:
set HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_GT_LIB=win

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

Thank you Viktor to consider this feature.

$ hbmk2 -traceonly t
hbmk: Processing configuration: /usr/bin/hbmk.cfg
hbmk: Harbour compiler command:
-n2 t -i/usr/include/harbour
hbmk: C compiler command:
gcc t.c   -O3  -ot -I/usr/include/harbour -L/usr/lib/harbour 
-L/usr/lib/harbour -Wl,--start-group -llibharbour -lhbcplr -lhbdebug 
-Wl,--end-group

I'd prefer something like this (only 2 lines) :
harbour -n2 t -i/usr/include/harbour
gcc t.c   -O3  -ot -I/usr/include/harbour -L/usr/lib/harbour 
-L/usr/lib/harbour -Wl,--start-group -llibharbour -lhbcplr -lhbdebug 
-Wl,--end-group

=> remove line starting with "hbmk: " perhaps with -quiet ?
=> add "harbour" to the harbour compiler command

So i can cut and paste or edit and run to make some tests ... very usefull
For example, now i can fix the -llibharbour => -lharbour ;-)

Yes, agreed, packaging must be in distros ...

Can't judge either. Especially since I don't know what
was the problem.

Which macros in which scenarios exactly?

What do we still miss to replace hbce* macros with hbmk2?

OK. But I think I need to change quite a few things before I can.

Hi Przemek,
I'll add this. Can we rename these switches to '-hbdir[inc|bin|lib]' ?
they'd align a bit better and would allow make future extensions
a little bit easier.

I have a new dir for dynamic libs in hbmk2, so maybe we could
also have an -hbdirdyn.

Brgds,
Viktor

Done. See note about cmdlines with scripts, which still hold
a header.

I've added it.

I've fixed that, and the problem wasn't exactly that. See ChangeLog.
Pls tell if it still doesn't work.

Subject: [Harbour] QT - One unresolved warning
Message-ID: <22912989.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello All

In QT builds you can see a lot of warnings like:

../../hbqt_qwidget.cpp:607: warning: taking address of temporary

which is the result of call like this:

/*
 * QPoint mapTo ( QWidget * parent, const QPoint & pos ) const
 */
HB_FUNC( QT_QWIDGET_MAPTO )
{
   hb_retptr( &( ( QPoint ) hbqt_par_QWidget( 1 )->mapTo( hbqt_par_QWidget(
2 ), 
                                                                                  
*hbqt_par_QPoint( 3 ) ) ) );
}

&( ( QPoint )  though return a pointer but this warning still surfaces.

Anybody with a clue how it can be fixed?

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

What's the problem?
I created manually harbour.dll and it works.

You haven't added hbmainwin/hbmainstd lib to the linked library list.
Please add one of the above libraries depending on CUI/GUI switches
as object file (without LIB directive).

It is. From printf() man page:

    0   The value should be zero padded.  For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e,
        E,  f, F, g, and G conversions, the converted value is padded on
        the left with zeros rather than blanks.  If the 0  and  -  flags
        both  appear,  the  0  flag is ignored.  If a precision is given
        with a numeric conversion (d, i, o, u, x, and X), the 0 flag  is
        ignored.  For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.

But please also remember that flag precedence may depend on type of
conversion.
In hb_snpritf() I tried to replicate the explicitly defined and also some
undocumented modifier precedences.
It will be good to fully replicate it also in the .prg SPRINTF wrapper.

I leave it without path because I have harbour install out from SVN 
folder and I do every time I need to build

set HB_COMPILER=mingw (or what compiler I need)
set path=j:\cvs\harbour_%HB_COMPILER%\bin;%PATH%

and my ..\..\..\bin folder contains only SVN files.
I thought to put
..\..\..\tools\hbmk2\%HB_ARCHITECTURE%\%HB_COMPILER%\hbmk2
that surely exists, but we lost HB_ARCHITECTURE as needed var.

Is there any other suggestion ?
Otherwise I will revert that changes.

Best Regards,
Francesco

Hi Massimo,
please update with last SVN, rebuild all, then check if you need to 
remove ..\..\..\bin\ from line 8 of rebuild_hbqt.bat (see my other message).
Here it works correctly with mingw, also test demoqt

Francesco

Hi Pritpal,
This return a QPoint class in stack, you need return a new QPoint Class .-

hb_retptr( ( QPoint* ) new QPoint( hbqt_par_QWidget( 1 )->mapTo( hbqt_par_QWidget( 2 ),  *hbqt_par_QPoint( 3 ) ) ) );
  	
but is necessary to control their destruction as in all classes.
Well, when you are finished start the corrections.

These vars are not guaranteed to exist and they aren't needed for
hbmk2.

I'd suggest not to use a .bat file at all. It's platform specific so it's
always a problem.

IMO qt45.qtp should contain '-O=..' so that all that copying can be
removed, the cleanup should be done from .prg (if at all). Also, hbqtgen
could automatically pick up qt45.qtp if no file is specified so basically
all we'd need is:
> hbmk2 hbqtgen -run

I think that's much simpler than maintaining such batch file, and
either way you put it, it won't work out of the box for all users.

Brgds,
Viktor

It does work, although you need to read INSTALL and follow the
instructions. Please use the recommended GNU make executable,
your version is an old one with known bugs.

  * harbour/harbour-wce-spec
    ! fixed MinGWCE cross compilation for Pocket PC by simple removing
      __PLATFORM__WINCE from Harbour build parameters. It's now defined
      by config/wce/mingwarm.cf
      BTW why it's called mingwarm not mingwce? Is is planed to add for
      each CPU type separate .cf file? For Linux it will be more then
      20 files.
      I do not know if MS plans to release (or maybe released) WinCE for
      non ARM based computers (f.e. x86 ones) but it may happen. Just like
      non x86 normal Windows ports may exist.

Bingo, thank you, I'll commit that trick to hbmk2.

Now only this warning remains:
Warning! W1171: Locally defined symbol hb_stricmp is imported.

(why only this one, I don't know. It's caused by '-lhbcplr -lhbpp
-lhbcommon'
parameters when building hbrun-dll, hbmk2-dll)

Viktor

Not only this one. In general we do not revert export/import flag
at all what may cause some bad results. As I can see for
hb_vmSetLinkedMain() and hb_gtSetDefault() you simply removed
import attributes from some builds to pacify warnings. It should
be done in different way. We need macro to define HB_EXPORT as HB_IMPORT.
Probably -DHB_EXPORT=HB_IMPORT is enough but I haven't tested.
The fact that the harbour.dll works suggests that some C compilers can
resolved wrong definitions in some hidden way at least using import
library. Maybe with valid flags some of them will be able to use
harbour.dll directly.
BTW in Linux shared builds are broken in hbmk2 and still -llibharbour
is used instead of -lharbour.

Message-ID: <18d502870904061359m74dc7561w381c6441d9464dfb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Back to unified/standalone releases:

For those who want an also standalone, self-contained ready-to-use and no
hassle Harbour installation, but find the
'full' package too large, here come two lighter downloads:

- Minimal package:
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-mini-20090331.7z (17MB)
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-mini-20090331.exe (17MB)

Installed size: 115MB

It contains MinGW x86 shared and static libs and embedded MinGW
compiler.

- Normal package:
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-20090331.7z (34MB)
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-20090331.exe (34MB)

Additionally to minimal, it contains MSVC x86 and x64 libs, MinGW x64
and WinCE/ARM libs, BCC libs. By default, only x86 libs are installed,
and x64/CE shared libs aren't included at all.

Installed size: 160MB (37MB - 219MB)

- Full package (previously posted with a different name):
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-full-20090331.7z (146MB)
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-full-20090331.exe (148MB)

Installed size: 1.3GB (37MB - 1.3GB)

Additionally to normal installation, it contains x64 tools, x64/WinCE/ARM
shared libs, Open Watcom and Pelles C libs (x64 and WinCE/ARM),
plus embedded MinGW64 and MinGWCE.

All above release are compatible with each other, which means
they are created from the same set of files, they use the exact
same dir layout, the only difference is components included and
default install settings.

Brgds,
Viktor

I'm afraid I cannot oversee this for full Harbour, I'd appreciate if
someone
could help fixing it.

-llibharbour is used since the beginning. The problem was arch/comp
lib dir autodetection. After today's fix it should work again.

Now it is more friendly.

BTW one another angle could be:
FULL - All Compilers ( meant to be INCLUDED )
       - Harbour Libs ( All Compilers )

PARTIAL - Harbour Libs ( All Compilers )

That way users can download FULL once and continue
with partial until we embed any more compiler in distro.

Hello Xavi

This is the warning layer I receive when compile with 
MinGW 4.3.3 which is included in Viktor's distribution.

I do not get this warning if I compile with MinGW distro accompanying
QT itself which is a probably version 3.4.2 | 5.

Fine, but until I get some further information on this I wouldn't like to
touch it. Here it works (and it always did, moreover it
did work other too) and I don't understand why can it work
here and why not on other distros or installations.

I'd like to ask those who don't have it working to post some
details (like -trace -info output) instead of "doesn't work".
Thank you.

Brgds,
Viktor

    ! Renamed to have all lower case. Please stick to this rule.
      Couldn't find any reference to this file, please fix it 
      where needed.

    ; TOFIX: hbqt.h has hb_ToOutDebug() declared as external. So, 
             hbqt will also depend on xhb lib? If this function is 
             so important I'd suggest to create a fully portable 
             version of it locally in hbqt.

  - contrib/hbqt/gensource/Makefile
    - Removed duplicate copy of Makefile. I'm not sure what was 
      the purpose but it wouldn't work here, and it wouldn't be 
      good to update this file in two copies.

But this trick not work with field :(
PUBLIC LongFieldName := IIF(.T., @LONGFIELDN,)  // error not variable
LONGFIELDN
I try open original (not create by my) index CDX (inside index is long filed
name)

PS.
Can Harbour open (only for read) index CDX from Visual FoxPro 6?
I get: Error DBFCDX/1012  Corruption detected.

See the messages from Guy Roussin.
He tries to inform you that it's broken sending -trace output and
you are systematically ignoring his messages. I have no idea what
else we can do for you.

No I didn't ignore it, but spent two hours trying to find the
cause, and found one which fixed it here, committed it,
sent comment in ChangeLog entry, answered Guy's
messages, plus implemented some requests, asked for
feedback and got ignored.

Pls don't bend the facts. Or pls go along and fix it if it
doesn't work for you.

I guess it wouldn't have hurt if you'd post your -trace -info
output, which I didn't receive so far either from you or Guy.

Unbelievable.

Brgds,
Viktor

The problem is still here. Exactly the same one (svn 10804)

Probably it's result of my fatal English and you do not understand me.
Let's try again from the beginning.
On some platforms like Linux libraries use strict prefix and suffix.
When you call gcc (and to be precise ld using gcc as wrapper) then
you can specify libraries in two ways:
1. giving them explicitly with full name and path if necessary, f.e.:
   libharbour.so or libhbvm.a
2. using -l option, f.e. -lharbour or -lhbvm
In the second case GCC respects also -L option and looks for given libraries
in directories specified by -L option and default library paths (the exact
paths depends on used system configuration). To the name given after -l
parameter is added library prefix and suffix used for shared and static
libraries. Usually shared libraries have higher priority then static ones
so 1-st it looks for them until -static option is not used.
It means that when you use: -llibharbour then gcc in systems like Linux
looks for liblibharbour.so and then for liblibharbour.a. In both cases
we have double lib prefix so it cannot work until we do not rename our
libharbour.so to liblibharbour.so or create such link.
This is the problem and I thought we clearly tried to tell you about it.
I have no idea from were you found information that it may work for you.
For sure it's not possible that it will work with the systems where
strict library prefix is used like Linux. Here you are using -lm for math
library, -lc for C library, -lz for zlib library, etc. Not -llibm, -llibc,
-llibz, ... which simply will not work.
AFAIR few weeks ago I was writing very similar message to this list.
I do not think that -trace -info output can help you in understanding the
above fact in any way anyhow I'm attaching it. For me all what you have to
do is removing the lib prefix from -llibharbour what Guy asked you in the
1-st message:

IMHO it contains whole information necessary to locate and fix the problem
with correct conclusion about the reason of problem and I honestly have to
say that I do not understand your answers how your modifications may change
gcc/ld behavior in Linux.
If the above is not clear enough then sorry but I'm not able to help you.
The only one think which can be interesting for me is the answer what
is 'here' when you were writing:

Thanks Guy, the libdirs are still wrong, could you post your -trace -info
output? (-info is the important bit here)

I think in the use of collectible pointer to *new* pointers dynamically allocated, in order to automatic call the destructor of
class for *delete*

  * bin/postinst.bat
    ! Fixed shared executable creation for cross-builds.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.hbm
  * utils/hbi18n/hbi18n.hbm
    % Added -nulrdd. This will remove the hbmk2 build size overhead
      compared to GNU Make built executables.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    ! Don't add the same libdir twice in some cases.
    + Added support for wce arch in remaining places.
    ! Added hbmainwin and hbmainstd for mingw targets.
      This should fix some failing shared lib scenarios I've
      experienced with minwgce. I hope it doesn't break
      everything else (tested mingw64 and mingw scenarios worked).
    * Internal change to handle shared libname separately
      so that special extensions and handling can be added
      for it, if needed.

Pritpal,
	
I think we need another version of Qt to compile with MinGw 4.3.3.
Qt 4.5 distribution using MinGW (GCC) 3.4.5 (mingw-vista special r3).
I am compiling harbour with this version.

I'm using 4.3.3 and besides these warnings, things seem to work.
The only issue I've seen is missing QT menu highlight when using
wvtext. In demoqt the same menu is fine.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yep, these are warnings only, code works fine, or 
may be until that point we exploit QColor like constructs
which are producing warnings.

Menu event is handled by WVT window procedure so I assume
that this event is not recognized by QT. It needs deeper investigations
though.

Viktor,

I have studied the differences in built-in defines .-

cpp -dD

And I see that in 4.3.3 there is a new macro .-

#define __declspec(x) __attribute__((x))

Could this be the cause but I don't know.

Xavi

I have in lib list LIBRARY d:\watcom\lib386\nt\Uuid.Lib, IID_IPicture is in ocidl.h (in watcom and bcc32)
but in wvgcore.c this file is not included (it is included only in wvgsink.c). This example once worked at xHarbour.
I have too trouble with :

Hi Pritpal:

Could you guide me on how to build libhbqt.a ?
Maybe I could be good to put a little howto in C:\harbour\contrib\hbqt\tests

Thanks in advance
Angel

When I run :

and hbmk2.exe is today build (?hbmk2            exe?1 082 368?07-04-09?21:33), have I :
Error E2030: fie clib3s.lib(cstrtwwt): multiple starting addresses found

and when hbmk2.exe is from Viktor's file harbour-11-win-20090331 (1).7z (?hbmk2            exe?  847 369?30-03-09?11:50)
then hbqtgen is correct build.

Is code hbmk2 ok ?

Sorry, I was wrong :'(
It is also in gcc (GCC) 3.4.5 (mingw-vista special r3)
Well, it's possible that this version not detect the warning.

These components use Harbour functions which aren't made
public from Harbour .dll. As I went through the list most of these
aren't exported for a good reason (they are internal, private functions),
maybe few of these could be add to official Harbour API and thus
exported. I don't want to make any such decision though, hopefully
someone else will.

Until then, you can add static libs to resolve the missing symbols:
hbmk2 my.prg -lhbwin -lxhb -shared -lhbvm -lhbrtl -lhbcommon -lhbmacro

Some more comments:
- Mindaugas's new OLE implementation uses much less internals,
  so some of these will be resolved, when we switch to it.
- It may not be an option for you, but for the record: switching to
  MinGW resolves these problems automatically.
- Even simply switching to the MinGW made Harbour .dll could resolve it,
  if you'd add -bcc prefix to those and create BCC implib for them using
  'implib -a'. For me it failed due to some unresolved symbols, because
  '-a' seems to forget (?) to add leading underscore to some public symbols.
  [ we had the same problem with OpenSSL implibs for BCC. ]
  Couldn't find the reason for that.
- Obvious choices are to reduce reliance on these components, or
  just acknowledge the fact that they won't work in pure shared mode.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thank you 'lib' prefix is not longer added but now suffix '.so' is added
instead:

-lharbour.so causes that GCC looks for libharbour.so.a and then for
linharbour.so.so
Can you remove it? It's enough to use -lharbour instead of -lharbour.so

It's very bad idea. In windows .dll is self contain binary so in such
way you will create final executable with to independent copies of HVM
and some other functions. The binaries will be created but final
results unpredictable. F.e. some functions will operate on HVM stack
inside harbour.dll and some others on HVM stack linked with final
binaries. What will happen you can try to guess if you carefully study
map file and all function bindings in final binaries but for sure it
will not be correct behavior.
_NEVER_ make anything like that. When harbour.dll is used no other
libraries which are part for harbour.dll should be used to link
the program.

Hi Przemek,
Is it safe to do this, then?
hbmk2 -q0 -shared -ohbrun-dll  hbrun.hbm -lhbcplr -lhbpp -lhbcommon

If not, how to resolve it?

There was a question: Does Harbour support MDX Index?

I will not be online for the next week or so (Happy Passover to you all),
so please close this request on SF if you could, if not, I'll do it next week.

Little bit corrected bullet points:

1. Install QT 4.5. The default location is C:\Qt\2009.01\qt, if you change
it,
    also change paths used in steps below.
2. Use 'set HB_INC_QT=C:\Qt\2009.01\qt\include' before doing the build (see
INSTALL).
3. Do a Harbour build (see INSTALL).
4. If you want to rebuild hbqt sources, see: *
5. Check in lib folder the presence of libhbqt.a
6. Stay in:   contrib/hbqt/tests
7. Issue: hbmk2 demoqt -LC:\Qt\2009.01\qt\lib
8. Copy QT .dlls from C:\Qt\2009.01\qt\bin next to demoqt.exe,
    or add this dir to the PATH.
9. Exec: demoqt.exe

*:
If you want to rebuild hbqt sources, you should do these additional steps
(notice for ourselves: This shouldn't be the job of users IMO, but rather
the sources should
be update on SVN as the generator/input files change):
4.1. Stay in contrib/hbqt/generator
4.2. Issue:    hbmk2 hbqtgen -run
4.3. Do a Harbour build [enough to do a local "make clean install" in hbqt].

Brgds,
Viktor

In xHarbour in file wvtcore.c is included 
#include "hbgtwvt.h" 
and in hbgtwvt.h is :
#if defined(__MINGW32__) || defined(__WATCOMC__) || defined(_MSC_VER)
   #include <ocidl.h>
And in ocidl.h is defined (in watcom and bcc32 einwironment !)  :
EXTERN_C const IID  IID_IPicture

In harbour I do not see this road from wvgcore.c file.
Pritpal, can you see this ?

[ this isn't fatal, but MT shared libs aren't generated ]

win / msvc64 (not fatal):

This code is also problematic for pocc64, mingw64 throws warnings.
It seem firebird header uses different types when compiled for win64.

I add to some step:
ps. harbour is install on e:\harbour
    qt is install on e:\qt


step 1: make file 'qt.bat' into \harbour\
----------------------
set path=e:\qt\mingw\bin;e:\harbour\bin;%path%
set HB_COMPILER=mingw
set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=e:\harbour
set HB_WITH_QT=yes
set HB_QTDIR=e:\qt\qt
set HB_INC_QT=e:\qt\qt\include
----------------------
run cmd.exe and run qt.bat

step 2: make file 'Makefile' into \harbour\contrib\hbqt\tests\
----------------------

OBJS = demoqt.o

HRBLIBS = \
	-L"$(HB_INSTALL_PREFIX)\lib" \
	-lhbmainwin \
	-lhbdebug \
	-lgtgui \
	-lgtwin \
	-lhbqt \

	-lhbpp \
	-lhbrdd \
	-lrddntx \
	-lrddcdx \
	-lrddfpt \
	-lhbsix \
	-lhbcommon \

QTLIBS = $(HRBLIBS)\
			-L"$(HB_QTDIR)\lib" \
			-lQtCore4 \
			-lQtGui4 \
			-lqtmain \
			-lQtWebKit4 \
			
GCCLIBS = \
			-L"$(HB_QTDIR)\mingw\lib" \
			-lstdc++ \

LIBS =	$(HRBLIBS) \
				$(QTLIBS) \
				$(GCCLIBS) \

	
demoqt:	$(OBJS)
	gcc -o demoqt $(OBJS) $(LIBS)

demoqt.o:	demoqt.c
	gcc -c -I$(HB_INSTALL_PREFIX)\include demoqt.c 

demoqt.c:	demoqt.prg
	harbour -m -n demoqt.prg
	
----------------------
run mingw32-make.exe and create 'demoqt.exe'


step 3: copy some file from e:\qt\qt\bin\ 
----------------------
mingwm10.dll  
QtCore4.dll   
QtGui4.dll    
QtNetwork4.dll
QtWebKit4.dll 
----------------------

run demoqt.exe

[ manual Makefile snipped ]

Please also try the recommended way with hbmk2, it does
a similar job to your manual Makefile, but it's portable, works
for all future test programs and just one line.

If hbmk2 doesn't work for you for some reason, post your
-trace output here.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

Fine here with svn 10815

Perhaps you can add a line for "-traceonly" option in
"hbmk2 -help"

I found the name "-traceonly" not very accurate because
we need "-quiet" to have *only* trace ...
Perhaps, the name "-trace" is better or, another option
is to automatically  activate "-quiet" when we use "-traceonly"

However, not very important ...

Guy

Probably I should not show Harbour users this hack in the past.
Now it can be source of bad problems.
In this particular case nothing very wrong will happen.
Only some part of common and pp library code will be repeated
but it does not use any static variables or function references so
it will work.

Message-ID: <18d502870904080438u620b990bm51c2a2413abc1560@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I've updated the unified release to the latest Harbour version, and
this time with only one package which, hopefully will fit most
users' needs:

http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-20090408.7z (48MB)
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-20090408.exe (50MB)
Installed size: 168MB (40MB - 314MB)

It contains all components of former 'full' package, with some more
fine grained control and without mingw64/mingwce embedded
versions to keep size down. Now there is a README with links and
short instructions how to get these tools from official locations.

The default installation will install MinGW compiler + x86 static and
shared libs, MSVC and BCC x86 libs and examples.

Options: x86 shared tools, x64 shared tools, MinGW x64 and WinCE-ARM libs,
MSVC x64 libs, Open Watcom x86 libs, Pelles C x86/x64/WinCE-ARM libs,
shared x64/WinCE-ARM libs.

Usage:
1) install/unpack to any directory (C:\harbour-11)
2) go to bin dir (optional if you specify path for hbmk2)
3) For x86 executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg'
4) For x64 executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg -comp=mingw64'
5) For WinCE/ARM executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg -comp=mingwarm'

Tools/libs used to create the package:
MinGW 4.3.3, MinGW64 4.4.0, MinGWCE 4.1.0, BCC 5.5.1, Open Watcom 1.8,
MSVC 2008, Pelles C 5.00.1, ace 9.10, allegro 4.2.2, blat 2.6.2, libcurl
7.19.3,
firebird 2.1.1, freeimage 3.11.0, gd 2.0.34, mysql 5.0.67, openssl 0.9.8j,
pgsql 8.3.3, qt 4.5.0 (2009.01)

Feedback is welcome, I plan to make this the default format for the next
official release for Windows/Windows CE platforms.

Brgds,
Viktor

[ Note: Some of the size growth is attributed to hbqt lib, especially
with MSVC, which is C++ and huge. It's not a problem, but please
keep this in mind when comparing size to prev versions. ]

Yes. Thank You, for information. I found (and implemented) both cases of 
ignored 0 flag in my tests.

This is no problem, since a separate "case TYPE:" is used in code for 
each conversion type, so precedence can be managed locally  for each type.

Yes. Though only good tests shows the exact algorithm of sprintf(). 
Please, tell if you find some incompatibilities in hb_strformat() behaviour.

Hi,


> Current code is very short and simple. At least I understand it so far ;-)

The simplicity was the main goal, after I found original OLE is not 
working (it was xHarbour times) and I was unable to understand some 
implementation ideas.

> 1. Empty date in hbwin TOLEAUTO is send as VT_NULL. Should we replicate it?

Well, it would be nice to hear OLE users opinion. Does OLE has EMPTY 
DATE, etc.?

> 2. HB_IT_POINTER support. Should we add it?

If we put some objects, etc, into untyped pointer it is not very good 
idea, but may be it could be useful in some case. Does anyone uses such 
features?

> 3. Array support. Should we add it?

It would be a feature. Does anybody have some sample code using OLE arrays?

> 4. OLECREATEOBJECT() and OLEGETACTIVEOBJECT() return simple pointer item.

I'll add it.

> 5. The hbwin TOLEAUTO class supports iteration by FOR EACH loop.
>    Should we add it too?

I've looked to hbwin OLE code. Each object uses ::pOleEnumerator to 
store enumerator. It is not very good solution, since we can have a few 
FOR EACH loops inside each other for the same object. I'll try to find a 
better way of implementation. Do we have any FOR EACH sample code for OLE?

> 6. Should we add passing parameters by reference?

Any sample code?

> 8. s_lOleError should be thread local to make it MT safe.

I see it is already implemented. Thank You.

If you are looking at it, please make it syntactically compliant with 
hbwin/win_ole.c parameters, i.e., TOleAuto() class with <hObj> <oObj>.
Then it attains staus of replacing the hbwin->ole implementation.

Over the years, code has evolved around <hbwin> and it will be trivival
to rewrite everything.

I've chosen HB_OLEAUTO to be consistent with Harbour convention, I can 
easily change it, but "TOleAuto" breaks this rule.

I'm against :hObj, because:
1) it does not allow to use any OLE classes having Hobj method;
2) it is internals of object, that's why we have __hObj (two 
underscores). You should not use it at all.

Mindaugas

Okay I see now.

Just to clarify: This has nothing to do with GTWVT. GTWVT is okay.

It's some kind of GTWVG compiler compatibility issue.

I also opt for clean code. If compatibility is such concern we should find
some optional compatibility layer. Maybe cleaner OLE implementation
will result in more robust app/3rd party lib code, too, which is always
a good thing.

But the question is what is that "comatibility layer"?
This does not mean that you have to have "cleaner code"
in comparison to "working code".

Something what is tackled on top of our clean solution.
Like a compatibility class with compatibility features.
Completely separate from clean solution.

I'm not sure about your point.

"working" doesn't automatically mean: working in all cases,
secure, maintainable, free from internals and bad practices,
conforming to stds, portable, etc. For me "clean" means
these properties.

Viktor

Hi Mindaugas.

This is the part of FWH activeX class:

---cut---
METHOD Default() CLASS TActiveX

   local hSink, aEv, bOldError, oError

   ::hActiveX = CreateActiveX( ::cProgId, ::nStyle, ::nLeft, ::nTop,
::nWidth, ::nHeight, ::hWnd, 0 )

   ::hObj = AtlAxGetDisp( ::hActiveX )

   bOldError = ErrorBlock( { |x| break( x ) } )

   begin sequence
      ::oOle = ToleAuto():New( ::hObj )
   recover using oError
      AcpInfo( oError:Description )
   end sequence

   ErrorBlock( bOldError )

   if !( ::aEvent == nil )

      for each aEv in ::aEvent
          ::EventMap( aEv[ 1 ], aEv[ 2 ], Self )
      next

      SetupConnectionPoint( ::hObj, @hSink, ::aAxEvent, ::aAxExec )

      ::hSink = hSink

   endif

return nil
---cut---

The main problem of the new OLE is that it not accept hObj as a
parameter like: ToleAuto():New( hObj ), but old OLE from hbwin accept
and works fine with FWH.

Maybe we can implement our own ActiveX class ?

If you need any activeX sample or source I can share it.

Regards,

Toninho.

Probably any date earlier then 1899-12-30 will create problems for
applications which does not try to convert the value to julian.
Anyhow, it's possible that negative values will work with some
OLE systems which makes such conversion. In such case using VT_NULL
will cause that date type will be lost.
I do not know why it was introduced. Probably it was necessary for
some programs.
Maybe we should follow the rules in other dbase compatible languages.
Does xbase++ supports OLE? If yes what it does with dates earlier then
1899-12-30 and empty date?

Yes, passing pointers to Harbour structures is bad idea. Such functionality
can be usable probably only to exchange pointers to some system structures/
resources or returned by other OLE calls.
I have no idea if it's usable.

We can implement it though here I see two potential problems to resolve.
1. In MSDN I've found that cyclic references are forbidden so we should
   block such arrays conversion. Anyhow this protection can be added
   later. It may be necessary to avoid infinite conversion loop/recursive
   calls.
   Probably we should add RT error for all unsupported types.
   IMHO is better then passing NIL/VT_NULL.
2. I've found also information that all items in array should have the same
   type declared in array header. Old OLE code does not respect it.
   How it looks in the real world? Should we ignore it?

>> 4. OLECREATEOBJECT() and OLEGETACTIVEOBJECT() return simple pointer item.

Fine.

This can be quite easy resolved.
Two possible solutions:

1-st: we add to HB_OLEAUTO class:

   METHOD __enumStart( enum, lDescend ) CLASS HB_OLEAUTO
      LOCAL hObjEnum

      hObjEnum := __OLECREATEENUM( ::__hObj, lDescend )

      IF !EMPTY( hObjEnum )
         IF !EMPTY( ::__hObjEnum )
            /* small hack - clone the object array for nested FOR EACH calls */
            self := __objClone( self )
         ENDIF
         ::__hObjEnum := hObjEnum
         /* set base value for enumerator */
         (@enum):__enumBase( self )
         RETURN .T.
      ENDIF

      RETURN .F.


   METHOD __enumSkip( enum, lDescend ) CLASS HB_OLEAUTO
      LOCAL lContinue, xValue

      IF lDescend
         xValue := __OLEENUMPREV( ::__hObjEnum, @lContinue )
      ELSE
         xValue := __OLEENUMNEXT( ::__hObjEnum, @lContinue )
      ENDIF

      /* set enumerator value */
      (@enum):__enumValue( xValue )

      RETURN lContinue


   METHOD PROCEDURE __enumStop() CLASS HB_OLEAUTO
      ::__hObjEnum := NIL     /* activate autodestructor */
      RETURN


2-nd: create new object used for enumeration and set it as __enumBase()
      value in __enumStart() method. For this object we can use
      HB_OLEENUM class.

      In HB_OLEAUTO class we will have to define only __enumStart() method

         METHOD __enumStart( enum, lDescend ) CLASS HB_OLEAUTO
            LOCAL pOleEnum

            pOleEnum := __OLECREATEENUM( ::__hObj, lDescend )
            IF !EMPTY( pOleEnum )
               /* set base value for enumerator */
               (@enum):__enumBase( HB_OLEENUM():new( pOleEnum ) )
               RETURN .T.
            ENDIF

            RETURN .F.

      and inside HB_OLEENUM class we will have to define at least
      __enumSkip() method:

         METHOD __enumSkip( enum, lDescend ) CLASS HB_OLEENUM
            LOCAL lContinue, xValue

            IF lDescend
               xValue := __OLEENUMPREV( ::pOleEnum, @lContinue )
            ELSE
               xValue := __OLEENUMNEXT( ::pOleEnum, @lContinue )
            ENDIF

            /* set enumerator value */
            (@enum):__enumValue( xValue )

            RETURN lContinue

      If it will be usable then we can also define __enumStop() method
      in this class.

In the second version we are loosing HB_OLEAUTO() object in __enumBase()
value so code like:
   enum:__enumBase():oleMethod(...)
will not work though also this can be implemented if we will keep pointer
to original HB_OLEAUTO object and redirect all messages to it. Anyhow
the 1-st version seems to be much easier to implement.

>> 6. Should we add passing parameters by reference?
> Any sample code?

I guess you are asking about real life usage.
Sorry I cannot help here.

Hello Viktor!

Congratulations on the excellent work! One suggestion if you allow me,
is what the UPX allows various levels of compression and would be
instead of "-compr" can use something like "-upx" or "-upx=N" or even
perhaps something like "-compr=N" where N is the number of desired
compression.

What do you think?

Hi Vailton,
Thanks. I was thinking about implementing this, but we need
to make these compression levels abstract, because UPX is an
implementation detail, and it may change in future versions or
different compressor may be used on specific platforms. So we
need to create some mapping and do in a way which won't tie
our hands in the future.

If this gets some more votes, I can implement something like:
-compr=min, -compr=max to choose the lowest and highest
compression, while -compr[=def] would select the default. That
probably fits most scenarios. Your comments are welcome.

BTW, in any case you can use the UPX envvar to supply custom
parameters.

Brgds,
Viktor

I vote for -compr=min|max|def options, I believe these options are
very intuitive and easily for all.

Hi,

My installation is Arch Linux 64bit, compiler gcc.

I am getting the following error:

make[3]: Entering directory
`/home/vagskarm/my_svn/harbour/contrib/hbqt/linux/gcc'
gcc -I. -I../../../../include  -Wall -W -O3   -fPIC  -I/usr/include

../../hbqt_qfont.cpp: In function ?void HB_FUN_QT_QFONT_HANDLE()?:
../../hbqt_qfont.cpp:147: error: ?HFONT? was not declared in this scope

After some search for HFONT i found the following at hqfont.h :

#ifdef Q_WS_WIN
    HFONT handle() const;
#else // !Q_WS_WIN
    Qt::HANDLE handle() const;
#endif // Q_WS_WIN

Does it have to do with the compilation error ?

Must i build first harbour and then the sources for qt ?

Vagelis

I can assume that on linux HFONT is not supported,
as per above, instead it should be Qt::HANDLE.

Now the question is how should we resolve it?

Not neccessarily, though it should be a good-practice rule.

 From the documentation:

HFONT QFont::handle () const
Returns the window system handle to the font, for low-level access. 
Using this function is not portable.

My suggestion is to remove the function from hbqt, because is not portable.

H Pritbal,

I made a change at hbqt_qfont.cpp :

HB_FUNC( QT_QFONT_HANDLE )
{
//   hb_retptr( ( HFONT ) hbqt_par_QFont( 1 )->handle() );
   hb_retptr( (Qt::HANDLE*) hbqt_par_QFont( 1 )->handle() );
}


But it is not only this.

Also hbqt_qregion.cpp:

HB_FUNC( QT_QREGION_HANDLE )
{
   //hb_retptr( ( HRGN ) hbqt_par_QRegion( 1 )->handle() );
   hb_retptr( ( Region ) hbqt_par_QRegion( 1 )->handle() );
}

Also hbqt_qpixmap.cpp (commented a function because at qpixmap.h there is no
#else for the os):

/*
HB_FUNC( QT_QPIXMAP_TOWINHBITMAP )
{
   hb_retptr( new HBITMAP( hbqt_par_QPixmap( 1 )->toWinHBITMAP( ( HB_ISNIL(
2 ) ? ( QPixmap::HBitmapFormat ) QPixmap::NoAlpha : ( QPixmap::HBitmapFormat
) hb_parni( 2 ) ) ) ) );
}
*/

Also i am getting some errors from hbqt_qwidget.cpp, but after i make my 3
years old son korn-flakes i am going to look at it too.

One dummy idea would be to use the same environment variables. 

I am not so familiar with c but it seems to me strange the following i am
copying from qregion.h

#if defined(Q_WS_WIN)
    inline HRGN    handle() const { ensureHandle(); return d->rgn; }
#elif defined(Q_WS_X11)
    inline Region handle() const { if(!d->rgn) updateX11Region(); return
d->rgn; }
#elif defined(Q_WS_MAC)


Would it be problem to use the follwing syntax ? :

#if defined(Q_WS_WIN)
    inline HRGN    handle() const { ensureHandle(); return d->rgn; }
#elif defined(Q_WS_X11)
    inline HRGN handle() const { if(!d->rgn) updateX11Region(); return
d->rgn; }
#elif defined(Q_WS_MAC)

and the details to be handled at HRGN or whatever definition ?

Regards
Vagelis

p.s.: Still i am not sure if the qtdemo app will run without segmentation
errors at my 64bit linux os, like the past ones.

It means all functions supporting Windows constructs have to be commented
out.
Will do in a while.

Hi Pritbal,

This error still exists:

gcc -I. -I../../../../include  -Wall -W -O3   -fPIC  -I/usr/include 
-I/usr/include  -c ../../hbqt_qwidget.cpp -ohbqt_qwidget.o

../../hbqt_qwidget.cpp: In function ?void HB_FUN_QT_QWIDGET_WINID()?:

Does it belong to the same issue ?

Marcos,

For Win it's Ok, only in Q_WS_X11 HADLE is unsigned long.
I think it's portable but I have not tested.

Hi,

Since Pritbal is to going to define upper level classes (xbparts
compatible), i think it is better to handle different OS's at this level.

Vagelis

Probably it would be good to comment / delete these macros, too, they are
not used anywhere, but they refer to Windows types:
hbqt.h:
#define hbqt_par_HFONT( n )                  ( ( HFONT* ) hb_parptr( n ) )
#define hbqt_par_WId( n )                    ( ( HWND* ) hb_parptr( n ) )
#define hbqt_par_HDC( n )                    ( ( HDC* ) hb_parptr( n ) )

Brgds,
Viktor

Viktor,
	
hbmk2 always compile all the files in project .hbm file have changed or not?	
Is it not possible that only process the files change since the last time that compile?

Hi Xavi,
Yes, it always compiles everything in one pass. Incremental
link needs a different approach than hbmk2: defining/detecting
dependencies, handling locations, intermediate files, etc. There
are very good and mature tools for this on the scene (like
GNU Make). If you need such functionality I'd suggest to take
a look at -hbcmp and -hblnk options, which makes it possible
to integrate hbmk2 with any existing incremental make systems.

Maybe sometimes in the future, given enough time and drive,
such option will be implemented into hbmk2. It will probably
try to get around most existing complications with make tools,
and try to do the incremental support in a kind of automated,
no-configuration way. But even this needs an even more intimate
knowledge of the supported compiler and linker tools in order
to properly and automatically pick up dependencies (and their
timestamps), so it's certainly not a piece of cake.

It would make hbmk2 usable even for large projects I agree,
and could be *the* solution for 3rd party lib / tool developers
too, plugging this gap.

If anyone has any ideas / code to contribute, it can of course
speed up this process.

Brgds,
Viktor

Worked pretty good, thanks.

Also on rev.10756 and last svn (10284) I got this error message,
nothing to worry about, just FYI:

make[3]: Leaving directory `/d/cvs/harbour/contrib/hbwin/win/mingw'
make[2]: Leaving directory `/d/cvs/harbour/contrib/hbwin'

make[1]: *** [first] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/d/cvs/harbour/external'

Also, these are the vars that I'm using to compile Harbour:

mater how I try, I'm still getting the black DOS box.

I tried following:

Procedure HB_GTSYS
   REQUEST HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT
Return

Also this:

REQUEST HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT
ANNOUNCE HB_GTSYS

Also, here is the command line used to generate the app:

gcc obj/demo.o -o bin/demogtk.exe -L/harbour/lib -L../../lib
-Wl,--start-group -lxhgtk  -lhbdebug -lhbvm -lhbrtl -lhbrdd -lhbrtl
-lhbvm -lhbmacro -lhbpp -lhblang -lhbcpage -lhbcommon -lrddntx
-lrddcdx -lrddfpt -lhbsix -lhbhsx -lgtgui -lgtwin -Wl,--end-group -lm
-luser32 -lwinspool -lole32 -loleaut32 -luuid -lgdi32 -lcomctl32
-lcomdlg32 -lodbc32 `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0`

Thanks & Regards,
Rodrigo

Try removing the option -lgtwin of the command line.
I don't test.

Hi Xavi

It worked after I recompile the harbour by removing my old sets
HB_GT_LIB=yes, HB_MULTI_GT=yes and -lgtwin. But it breaks the ability
to switch to console app to gtwin and allow me debug the application,
just by specify the default gt, so I think it's not working as
designed, right?

Thanks & Regards,
Rodrigo

Now me too sis receiving this error.
As far as I remember, a month ack this error was 
non existant and I could compile and run demowvg.prg.
Now it is there.

I tried above solution but it did not help.

Did you find the solution?

One more update. I used to do in the past, just request GTGUI, Like this:

REQUEST HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT

so if I remove procedure HB_GTSYS, it complains about:

undefined reference to `HB_FUN_HB_GT_WIN'

Resuming:
- Removing -lgtwin and using the procedure HB_GTSYS + REQUEST
HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT, it works
- Removing -lgtwin and specify only REQUEST HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT, it
complains about HB_FUN_HB_GT_WIN
- Keeping -lgtwin and REQUEST HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT and/or ANNOUNCE
HB_GTSYS and/or Procedure HB_GTSYS, it keeps showing the DOS box.

Thanks & Regards,
Rodrigo

So, in the past, just request

Hello Everybody

Please download latest ready-to-use Harbour distro from 
http://www.vouch.info/downloads/HarbourDev_10824_2009-04-09.exe

It fixes few mis-managements in _10523_ distro released in March.

Please note that Open Watcom binaries produces unresolved externals
with demowvg.prg. Rest all is fine.

I wanted to include QT implementation also but has deferred that 
decision because still I am unable to find a way to compile demoqt.prg
through xMate PLUS a surprise that is swcheduled to be disclosed probably
next week...

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

PS: Note this is not an official release. It is an effort to ease out 
      migration to Harbour for newbies.

Then HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT is not working in Linux.
Don't know what is the alternative. 
Try HB_GT_NULL_DEFAULT.

Hi,

Thanks Lorenzo

Pritbal, i uncomment the hbqt.hbp line:

gt=gtnul

and rebuilded demoqt

Now running it i am getting:

[vagskarm@vsarch tests]$ ./demoqt
Xlib:  extension "Generic Event Extension" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "Generic Event Extension" missing on display ":0.0".

Plese notice that my installation is 64bit. Could it be possible the qt

It doesn't exist.

I suppose gtgui request is to avoid the console opening in win.

In Linux it's not a problem you can use both gtstd or gtnul.

Hello,

Thank you very much for your help.

I just searched for harbour_dev\mingw\lib\libmpr.a. But didn't find it.

I use xMate. I went to Environment Configuration -> Exe defaults -> Add. 
(But couldn't find libmpr.a)

Is there anything I did wrong, or I have to download the file?

TIA.

Regards.

harbour_dev\mingw\lib\libmpr.a  
is very much present there. May be it missed your search.

You are trying to add it the right way.

Issue c:\>dir \harbour_dev\mingw\lib\libmpr.a
and you must see it there.

Yes, it is there. Previously I tried with 
C:\harbour_dev\harbour\mingw\lib folder. ;(

I compiled it. First time it ran and then disappears. Then I copied some 
#include and #define codes from your example. Now it runs. :)

It's always thrilling to run a new software !!!! :)

Thank you. And I have some more questions.

It is running in command prompt box. No, extra window for it. And some 
times screen doesn't appear properly. It means I should study your 
examples thoroughly. :)

Thank you again for help and for the software. :)

Regards.

It must not run in the command box. It must open a new window.
You must study not only the code but also how the demo is linked.
You should take care of which parameters are on in demowvgMINGW.env
and demowvgMINGW.xhp.

I did this and also added following codes (copied from your example):-

   SET( _SET_EVENTMASK, INKEY_ALL )

   Wvt_SetGui( .t. )
   Wvt_SetMouseMove( .t. )
   Wvt_SetFont( "Courier New", 18, 0, 0 )

   CLS
   Wvt_ShowWindow( SW_RESTORE )


And guess what happens!!! It runs like a breeze!!!! :)
At first sight, it looks even better than my first program with gtwvw!!!
I must tell all my friends (incl CCH)!!!
I am sure there are lots and lots of things to be done with the software!!!
Thank you very much for your step by step guidance :)

With best regards.

This should be deleted from demoqt.prg and it will work:
---
PROCEDURE hb_GtSys()
   HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT()
   RETURN

Hi Pritpal

I too could compile and run demowvg.prg. GTWVG does not work only with
the extensions.
I change GT to the GTWVT, like Viktor inquired.
I not noticed that GTWVT is left and went from contrib to the
core\source\rtl.
I do not need to use GTWVG. My C and English is virtually, so that a
solution is not my level :).

GTWVT has always been in source/rtl (since it exists
inside Harbour anyway :)

I'm getting this when trying to create demowvg (using MinGW):
---
Generating C source output to 'demowvg.c'... Done.
C:/harbour-11/lib/win/mingw/libgtwvg.a(wvgsink.o):wvgsink.c:(.text+0x13ae):
undefined reference to `hb_ToOutDebug'
---

Both the lib and demowvg code contains explicit hb_ToOutDebug() references.

Viktor

Seems we'd need some protection to make it compile with older

I will strip this call, till then just add xhb.lib to the project, just to
test.

Of course it's possible with 
#if SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER >= 3xxxxxx

You can see this in hbsqlit3.c, but SQLite version 3.4.0 is too old. 

I can do it.

Hi,


I've fixed these warnings. Please test on MSVC64.

It is possible with GTWVT console.
Just follow Viktor's dstro and compile "hello.prg" in
WINCE mode.

I suggest try the Viktor's way
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/hb-1.1.0dev.7z
1) unpack to any directory (C:\hb-1.1.0dev)
2) go to bin dir (optional if you specify path for hbmk2
5) For WinCE/ARM executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg -comp=mingwce'



--------------------------------------------

Hi All,
I've made available a unified and self-contained Windows release
package, which is able to create x86, x64, WinCE/ARM executables
(both shared and static) out of the box without the need of any
external tools or settings.

Download:
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/hb-1.1.0dev.7z
(size: 136MB)

To use:
1) unpack to any directory (C:\hb-1.1.0dev)
2) go to bin dir (optional if you specify path for hbmk2)
3) For x86 executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg'
 4) For x64 executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg -comp=mingw64'
5) For WinCE/ARM executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg -comp=mingwce'

The package also contains Harbour libraries to build MSVC 2008,
Open Watcom 1.8 and Borland C 5.5.1 executables. For these,
you need to have these compilers installed on your computer. The libs
will automatically be picked by hbmk2.

The package contains MinGW 4.3.3, MinGW 4.4.0 for x64 and
MinGW 4.1.0 for ARM/CE embedded.

I've used 7-Zip instead of .zip, because it cut the archive size by
a factor of 2-3. If this package will get good reception I may add
installer with de-selectable x64, WinCE and additional target libs.
While it takes significant amount of time to assemble such package,
nevertheless IMO it should be the definitive and official release
methods instead of the separate compiler/CPU target specific
packages we offer for 1.0.1.

Following external dependencies were used to build corresponding
Harbour libs:

ace 9.10
allegro 4.2.2
blat 2.6.2
libcurl 7.19.3
firebird 2.1.1
freeimage 3.11.0
gd 2.0.34
mysql 5.0.67
openssl 0.9.8j
pgsql 8.3.3
qt 4.5.0 (2009.01)

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi All

Is there any portable solution to hb_ToOutDebug() ?
It sucks time and again. While developing you tend to skip
remove-overs while committing, a potential cause of 
frustration afterwards.

Thanks Pritpal.

I've checked the code and was thinking of adding something (not compatible
but with same purpose), but I'm still puzzled
on the needs. What I have for my own purpose is portable,
does proper locking but it's .prg stuff.

We'd need something simple in C using pure Harbour file IO,
preferable with permanently open file handle for good
performance (after all this should be usable for other things
than debugging).

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, but the instructions has changed since:
---
Hi All,
I've updated the unified release to the latest Harbour version, and
this time with only one package which, hopefully will fit most
users' needs:

http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-20090408.7z (48MB)
http://www.syenar.hu/harbour/harbour-11-win-20090408.exe (50MB)
Installed size: 168MB (40MB - 314MB)

It contains all components of former 'full' package, with some more
fine grained control and without mingw64/mingwce embedded
versions to keep size down. Now there is a README with links and
short instructions how to get these tools from official locations.

The default installation will install MinGW compiler + x86 static and
shared libs, MSVC and BCC x86 libs and examples.

Options: x86 shared tools, x64 shared tools, MinGW x64 and WinCE-ARM libs,
MSVC x64 libs, Open Watcom x86 libs, Pelles C x86/x64/WinCE-ARM libs,
shared x64/WinCE-ARM libs.

Usage:
1) install/unpack to any directory (C:\harbour-11)
2) go to bin dir (optional if you specify path for hbmk2)
3) For x86 executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg'
4) For x64 executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg -comp=mingw64'
5) For WinCE/ARM executable type: 'hbmk2 ../tests/hello.prg -comp=mingwarm'

Tools/libs used to create the package:
MinGW 4.3.3, MinGW64 4.4.0, MinGWCE 4.1.0, BCC 5.5.1, Open Watcom 1.8,
MSVC 2008, Pelles C 5.00.1, ace 9.10, allegro 4.2.2, blat 2.6.2, libcurl
7.19.3,
firebird 2.1.1, freeimage 3.11.0, gd 2.0.34, mysql 5.0.67, openssl 0.9.8j,
pgsql 8.3.3, qt 4.5.0 (2009.01)

Feedback is welcome, I plan to make this the default format for the next
official release for Windows/Windows CE platforms.

Brgds,
Viktor

[ Note: Some of the size growth is attributed to hbqt lib, especially
with MSVC, which is C++ and huge. It's not a problem, but please
keep this in mind when comparing size to prev versions. ]

Thanks a lot Mindaugas.
It now compiles fine with msvc64, with this only warning:
../../fbirddd.c(479) : warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'ISC_STATUS' to
'long', possible loss of data

It wasn't your target I know, but I've rechecked also with pocc64,
with these results:

IMO there is nothing in a core logging functionality which would need any
platform dependent parts. hbwin is no better
place than xhb lib in this respect.

We should rather have a simple hb_log*() API in core.

hb_logSetFilename() (default hb_log.txt ?)
hb_logEnable()
hb_logEvent()
hb_logForceClose()

This would add new lines to a text file on disk.

Brgds,
Viktor

This is nice alternative but I do not need a text file.
I rout output to windows debug stream which is picked by 
dbgview.exe, a tiny debugger, and it solves my demands.
Maybe we can rout output to debug stream in any way
I donot know.

There is no way to make that portable, so if this is the need,
I guess it won't make it to core.

I wonder though why such tool as dbgview is needed to
gather such simple text/line output, I can solve the same thing
with a simple file view in Far Manager. Can save it, search
in it, whatever. In fact this is what I use when inspecting build
output as they go. I see no reason to use any special, plat.spec
tool or API for this simple task.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello Everybody

Before starting the project XbpParts.lib (?) based on QT,
I need group opinion on the namespace we should be
using. All parts in Xbase++ begins with prefix "XBP".

If we retain the same namespace, i.e., existing code 
will be portable as is. Opinions...

Can you shed more light on "Far Manager" ?
It seems it does what I need.

It's an "orthodox" file manager, similar to Norton Commander
(or Total Commander, DOS Navigator), but native win32 (also
win64), it's a professional, rock solid tool, with CUI interface.
The author of rar compressor wrote it, now it's developed as
open source. It has a very nice editor and lots of (useful) plugins.

The file viewer (<F3>) has a very nice feature that it
automatically updates the view if you go to the end of file.

http://www.farmanager.com

Hard to measure but it makes me about 10 times quicker
in any task which involves text files or file management.

Brgds,
Viktor

I think we should keep the same namespace (XBP).
As for the lib's name: hbxbp

Yes. It's easy to build from source, but I suggest to start with the ready
made download on the main page. (which is still not free
though, but there isn't any serious restriction on the download
- well, I bought it anyway).

Takes long time to assemble, upload, download. Also, to me it
seems there isn't enough of a demand for x64/CE-ARM platform
to hit the package with 1GB of extra tools, plus 100MB extra
download.

It's also quite easy though to download a .zip or .gz file into its
place. Please check the READMEs.

Dunno. I used to pack the latest from everything. I certainly
won't prepare multiple versions in this package, but if group
thinks we can distribute and older version as a standard, but
it will also need extra work on my side, so I'm waiting for
feedback from ACE users, which is the "best" overall version
to include.

i strong prefer xbp as prefix  because they are xbase parts clone
so it is Immediatly usable without any wrapper

I wonder if you did any test with hb_ToOutDebug().
It is portable, I use it in Windows and in Linux.
It is useful to see live output on program running without have to press 
F3 on a file (I always use Total Commander that it is similar to Far 
Manager) and in Windows dbgview also permits to search inside, save 
logging to a file and also filters events and more.
Similar operation of hb_ToOutDebug() you can do also with hb_ToLogFile() 
that redirects output to a file.
Probably, or surely, it can be write better, but it does its job.
Actually it is not portable, as you wrote, because it is in xhb and not 
in core or in a default library.

Best regards,
Francesco

The concept isn't portable IMO (because it does different
things on different OSes), and it's too heavy still (with
other xhb dependencies, like hb_sprintf()).
I simply cannot see why such a simple thing should be
that complicated and OS specific. On normal OSes, logging
is always done to simple text files and there are proper
tools to "watch" such output files (like 'tail', or viewers
that are able to present "live" content, like Far Manager,
but it's probably not the only one). On "normal" systems
(meaning most systems besides Windows) system logging
is done to text files. (and not by such strange inventions
like "Event Manager" on Windows)

I also don't like the name which implies this is a debug
only function, and also the function names don't form a
common namespace (except hb_To*(), but this is too
generic). The functions also use C RTL file I/O and uses
C RTL printf() functions, which isn't ideal. They also don't
keep the output file open which has a few advantages and
makes code simpler, but causes a large performance hit,
especially on a network. The file logging feature is replicated
on .prg level instead of using the .c level implementation.
And the whole thing relies on the shady hb_outdebug()
interface which does different things depending on OS,
this function will use some local methods to generate temp
file, it also relies on X (which isn't necessarily present
on a *nix system). For me, also hb_outdebug(), hb_tooutdebug()
names are confusing. I'm not sure the code is MT ready
(see the "Caution" in hboutdbg.c, plus opening the same
file, moving to the end and writing into them without any
protection from two threads may also create problems).

For above reasons I didn't try these functions so far.

Finally, we already have the trace API in core which has
the same purpose as hb_ToOutDebug().

[ Sorry for such heavy e-mail on a Saturday morning :o]

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello, 

I totally agree with Toninho. HWIN.lib should include an ActiveX class. 

Oscar Lira libero long time ago for a public use ActiveX class. GUI's as
HWGUI, Mini, etc. .. are based on this class to support ActiveX. 
Plain C is built on and uses ATL of Microsoft Windows. 

Can download CActiveX class for tests.

This programming would be much easier.

BTW, what if we'd extend our current trace API with an option (controlled by
envvar HB_TR_WINOUTDBG=yes|no|only)
to push or also push message via OutputDebugString()?

This function can be used then, instead of hb_tooutdebug():
HB_TRACESTRING()

We could also add timestamp to trace messages. What other
features may be missing from HB_TRACESTRING() which
are present and important in HB_TOOUTDEBUG()?

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] RDDADS not building automatically
Message-ID: <23001243.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello,

RDDADS.LIB is not building when compiling Harbour SVN. This is correct ?

Building manually I have these errors:

[ERROR]
Error: Unresolved external '_hb_adsCloseCursor'
Error: Unresolved external '_hb_adsGetWorkAreaPointer'
[ENDERROR]

Could we build rddads harbour and automatically correct these errors?

Best regards,

Rossine.

    % added optional compilation HVM core files as single unit.
      It allows to use interprocedural optimizations for all defined
      functions. It's useful when compiler does not support IPO at link
      time. It should give some noticeable speed improvement for compilers
      which can benefit from such optimizations, f.e. GCC, ICC, MSVC.
      In my Linux box (GCC 4.3) it gives ~7% speed improvement in
      speedtst.prg linked with ST HVM and a little bit more in MT mode.
      It's interesting that it also reduces the HVM library size.
      At least for GCC builds.
      Set HB_HVM_ALL=yes envvar to enable such compilation.
      Warning some compiler may not compile such long single C file.

Great idea. Makes MSVC forced C++ mode and LTCG options unnecessary.Here it
caused a quite big speedup, especially with MSVC (12%), with
MinGW the difference was about 4%.

There is one catch though, fm.c is included in hbvmall, which causes that
-fmstat hbmk/hbmk2 options doesn't work.

Shouldn't we rework -fmstat so that it only changes the default value of
dynamic stat mode? This way the problem would be resolved, and with
hbvmall,
we've won back (many times) the small overhead of the extra flag checking
in fm.c.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello Everybody

I hae tried some constructs and have come up with :

http://www.nabble.com/file/p23004452/Harbour-QT-1.jpg Harbour-QT-1.jpg 

This transfers buffer contents of wvtext.prg as you can recognize.
It seems to be a long way to go, at least with me, as I feel too 
handicap with C++ and to an extent with QT's proprietory structures.

The actual window in this picture is larger than visible.

I need Przemek's help in this regard as I am totally lost how to 
structure GT interface.

Should I upload to contrib/gtqtc ?

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

It should eventually go to /source/rtl/gtqtc. First it's probably enough if
post it here and we will upload it when it a bit later.

First I'd like to settle the Makefile side of QT integration, we
will need the same with gtqtc.

Viktor

What I need is a function that permits a syntax like sprintf (but 
possibly on prg level adding possibility to have any type transformed to 
a string) limited to a part of code, without to have to enable tracing 
for every HB_TRACE() calls. And possibly to show result in a separate 
window that I can have opened side-by-side with application I want to 
trace. And, on Windows, if it uses dbgview (that I found a real useful 
utility already ready to use) it will be good.
And this has to be present either on prg than on c level possibly with 
same syntax.
Now if you want to call it hb_TraceString() or any other name for me it 
is not important.
Last addition I found useful (that I have in my own implementation) is a 
flag that when is active add stack trace on every function display (like 
TraceLog() function in xharbour that has the limit to not handle 
sprintf() syntax).

Actually if I write:
hb_ToOutDebug( "This is a number = %i, string = %s or any other type of 
sprintf or prg = %s\n\r", 30, "a string", { "an", "array" } )

I get in dbgview:
#  Time      Debug  Print
33 23.43.25  [5856] This is a number = 30, string = a string or any 
other type of sprintf or prg = A
MyFunction(10) in test.prg
Main(2) in test.prg

Another interesting addition can be to add a flag that permits to have 
defined where output have to be sent (like EXTERNAL WINDOW | FILE | 
BOTH, where EXTERNAL WINDOW can be dbgview in windows or a text file 
showed in a separate window) so I can have same tracing information sent 
both on dbgview than in a file.

The needs is to add some debugging / tracing functions to handle 
debugging of applications.
I don't know how you work, but I don't think that you debug your 
application only with ? or printf() and if yes if them are enough.

Also internal debug it's not enough in some occasions (like MT 
applications AFAIK).

Hope I'm clear.

Best regards,
Francesco

Still wondering what I miss to control text color.

Hello,

Is there any document from where I can get the use of different 
functions of WVG?

I used SAVE SCREEN, RESTORE SCREEN commands in my old Clipper programs. 
But, I can't use it with wvg_boxraised() or wvg_groupboxraised()  
commands. Is there any way to use it?

TIA.

Regards.

Sudip

GTWVG with WVG_*Gui functions are targetting where you open a new window
for save/rest screen mechanism. This is the only way where you can impose
GUI elements. Please investigate the My_Alert() function in demowvg.prg.
It demonstrate how you can open subsequenet modal windows with new
contents.

Hello,

Thanks a lot.

So, I shall create different windows for different forms (like I do with my
other windows programs!!!)

With best regards.

No. 

The only commands you need to issue at the begining and end would be
minimum:

---Clipper
SAVE SCREEN

---gtwvg
oCrt := WvgCrt():New( , , { -1,-1 }, { 24,79 }, , .t. )
oCrt:lModal := .T.
oCrt:icon := cIconFile
oCrt:create()
oCrt:resizable :=.T.
SETCOLOR(cColor)
CLS
// Needs #include "hbgtinfo.ch"
hb_gtinfo(HB_GTI_WINTITLE,cWindowCaption)

/* Your Clipper Codes goes here */

oCrt:destroy()


Alternatively you can call a function to wrap above lines.

The fundamental difference in pure windows program and GTWVG is
that you need not to change anything except adding few lines and /or 
calling two more functions.

Look at My_Alert() - A replacement to Alert() in :

http://www.nabble.com/file/p23011878/demowvg.prg demowvg.prg 

You may be interested in GetSome() and GetRange() functions added to 
demowvg.prg.

Hello Pritpal,

Thanks a lot for detailed help. I saw MyAlert also. Yes it will be very
helpful :-)

Now there is some complexity. My old clipper programs heavily depend on 
save screen, restore screen. So it will not be easy enough to add those 
codes in each and every save screen and restore screen (I used 
save_win() and rest_win() functions modified from Rick Spence's code)

Now, my solution will be:- Save_win()will return oCrt object and 
Rest_win() will destroy it!!! I have to try it out :-)

One thing more. I don't have GetSome() and GetRange() functions in my
demowvg.prg.

With best regards.

Sudip

Hello Mindaugas, 

I totally agree with Toninho. HWIN.lib should include an ActiveX class. 

Oscar Lira libero long time ago for a public use ActiveX class. Guis as
HWGUI, Mini, etc. .. are based on this class to support ActiveX. 
Plain C is built on and uses ATL. 

Attachment class with an example of how to use RMCHART.

In fact when an event should return an object and not the Event ID ago FWH.


This programming would be much easier.

After this
      set alternate to ( FN_ExtSet( hb_progname(), ".txt" ) ) additive

we lost compatibility with xHb (may be not only xHb)

  * tests/speedtst.prg
    ! Fixed missing hb_progname() for non-Harbour compilers.

  * include/hbextern.ch
    + Added time related new functions.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added -runflag: option to pass flags to target executable.
    + Started -inc (incremental link) support. It's very early
      stage, don't expect it to work yet and please don't report
      any problems with this feature yet.

  * source/vm/asort.c
    ! Fixed to return Clipper compatible results when non-logical
      non-numeric value is returned from ASORT() codeblock.

  * utils/hbtest/rt_array.prg
    * Cleaned ASORT() tests when sorting block returns constant value.
      Now Clipper results aren't bent anymore, instead I've added
      different expected results for Harbour and Clipper. The
      difference is due to different sorting algorithms used,
      here the point is to get similar *pattern* for different
      invalid values.

  * source/rtl/philes.c
    % HB_FGETDATETIME(): Removed double call to hb_stortdt().

  * contrib/hbqt/tests/hbqt.hbp
    * Removed extra line at EOL.

  * contrib/gtqtc/tests/hbqt.hbp
    ! Removed environment dependent 'libspath=' line.
      Please don't add such path to Harbour SVN, since these
      can differ from system to system and is also non-portable.
      The correct name of the directive is: 'libpaths='.

  * contrib/gtqtc/Makefile
    % Removed double SVN ID.
      This file needs to be updated according to hbqt latest
      Makefile portability changes.

  * contrib/rddads/ads1.c
    * Minor formatting.

Sorry, it is caused by an experiment left-over.
Please keep only demowvg.prg in the project tree,
remore all other files.

Should I include xhb compatible inkey() extended

IMO it should be.

NOTE: to control it via some #define will be difficult.

Since gtqtc is meant to be moved to core, it should behave the
_exact_ same way as other core GTs. To my knowledge xhb
inkey codes aren't implemented in other GTs, so it shouldn't
be for gtqtc.

Brgds,
Viktor

This doesn't make much sense. GTXWC, the *nix pair of GTWVT uses "C",
so whichever you choose someone can be unhappy. I've decided on "C"
because CUI vs. GUI is much more clear than "text" vs. "GUI". Notice
that GUI also has "text" not just images. If you mean "T" as "terminal",
it's already in "GT" in that meaning.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor!

I'm using hbmk2 in all my projects and working with MinGW + Win7 I
found a small problem with RC files. I created a single test in the
hope of contributing to the solution of the problem .. are basically 3
files:

t.prg file:
function main ()
     alert ( "Hello world!")
    return

t.rc file:
1 RCDATA test.txt

test.txt file:
"This is a single test!"


hbmk2 with option "-hbcmp" override the file generated from t.prg with
the contents of t.rc compiled and the linker fails:

It is common use in MiniGUI, FW, etc.. a resource file  with the same
name that contains routines for manipulating the dialogs/controls. And
I read the source in this case it uses for compiled RC the same
extension that the object files (*.o).

Hi Vailton,
I understand your problem, and it's caused by the way hbmk2
compiles and links .rc files. It currently uses .o for the extension
for compiled .rc files, which collides with compiled sources with
the same filename. The .o extension is used because windres
(while it also supports std .res output) has to compile
resources into coff format so that it can be used with gcc in link
phase. If someone knows a way to "teach" gcc.exe to understand
*standard* .res files, please speak up.

I'll modify hbmk2 to use .res extension for the coff compiled
resources, until we find a way to switch to real .res files.

Another consequence of the above is that you cannot feed .res
files pre-compiled with other tools to hbmk2 when using MinGW.
This could be resolved by adding .res to coff res conversion to
hbmk2 in MinGW mode, but I'll leave that for later.

[ Your English is perfectly fine! ]

Brgds,
Viktor

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added -workdir:<dir> cmdline option to override default
      working dir (arch/comp) in -inc mode.
    + Added support for working directory in -inc mode.
      Due to lack of output dir option in certain compilers
      (most sadly in gcc family), these compilers will have to
      be executed for each input file, slightly reducing
      performance. I hope some day their developers will add such
      basic option.
    + -quiet option will now suppress the header lines for
      executed commands, creating a good progress output with
      '-trace -quiet'.
    ! Fixed output related regressions in msvc/bcc.
    * Removed explicit warning level settings from C compiler
      options. User can override if needed.
    * Returns errorlevel 19 instead of 9 in help mode. Now 
      returns 9 if the working dir couldn't be created.
    ! Fixed resource compiler command for bcc, msvc, pocc.
      Turns out none of them supported multiple inputs.
    % Minor code size optimization in target output dependency
      checking.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    * Autodetection of embedded MinGW installation is now done
      *after* trying to detect user installed compiler. This way 
      it's more natural to use the unified build as it will
      automatically use the user's C compiler if setup. It's also
      easier to override MinGW in unified builds, since there
      is no need to force compiler using -comp: option, it's
      enough to put preferred C compiler in the PATH.

Run this command twice:
'hbmk2 test1 test2 test3.c test4.rc test5.obj -inc'

Then experiment with modifying sources.

Hi Adam,

How does it work in Clipper?
Could you post a working example to demonstrate it?

The one I created based on your description did the
exact same thing in both Clipper and Harbour.

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] Working with HASH()
Message-ID: <23034241.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello,

Is possible include "HSETAACOMPATIBILITY()" in harbour ?

In xharbour this example works:

[Code]
functio Main()

   LOCAL hHash := Hash()

   HSetAACompatibility( hHash, .T. )
   HSetCaseMatch( hHash, .F. )
   
   hHash[ "One" ]   := { 1, 1 }
   hHash[ "Two" ]   := 2
   hHash[ "Three" ] := 3
   hHash[ "Four" ]  := 4
   hHash[ "Five" ]  := 5
   
   ? hHash[ "One", 1 ] += 10
   ? hHash[ 1, 1 ] += 10

   WAIT

RETURN

[EndCode]

Is possible this work in harbour ?

Best Regards,

Rossine.

I'm sorry, You are right!
I often use DBU where cursor move correct. Now I look to source DBU and 
see, so I must self correct position cursor in TBrowse.

Thank You for Your quick ansfer.

Hi Vicktor
I am not able to generate valid libace32.a becasue is zero lenght
wich version do you use?
i copyed pexport.exe and dlltool in c:\devl\acesdk
cd \devl\acesdk
del libace32.a
pexports ace32.dll > ace32.def
set oldpath=%path%
set PATH=%~dp0
dlltool -d ace32.def -D a


This is my version
GNU dlltool (GNU Binutils) 2.19.1

Hi Massimo,

Hi Vicktor


[ It's Viktor with a 'k', or it's fine with a 'c' too, 'ck' is quite
strange. ]
I'm not sure what you're trying to do, I've posted my three lines
of commands in the message you replied to, but you've been
trying with different dlltool command. Correct it.

As I wrote even these three lines won't create usable implib,
you probably need to manually edit the .def file, but don't ask
me how. I suggest to contact the vendor of this lib to give
information on MinGW compatibility/usage. It's an expensive
product, probably they have some sort of support and maybe
this issue already appeared in their history.

Brgds,
Viktor

I have created a prg that create a large test1.prg and run with hbmk2 crea -run
mingw from last cvs
func main
   x_handle=fcreate("test1.prg")
   fwrite(x_handle,"func main"+chr(13)+chr(10))
   fwrite(x_handle,"test0001()"+chr(13)+chr(10))
   fwrite(x_handle,"return"+chr(13)+chr(10))
   fwrite(x_handle,""+chr(13)+chr(10))

   for a=1 to 9000
      x_num=right("0000"+alltrim(str(a)),4)
      fwrite(x_handle,"func test"+x_num+chr(13)+chr(10))
      fwrite(x_handle,"return"+chr(13)+chr(10)     )
      fwrite(x_handle,""+chr(13)+chr(10))
  next a

   fclose(x_handle)

If i repeat more times without modify
hbmk2 test1 -inc
incremental seem not work

I don't know what's not working for you, maybe you've
misunderstood the meaning of -inc.

Here is my test run, which shows that it's working. Notice
the second run of hbmk2 test1, which shows: "target up to date".
If you then touch test1.prg, test1.exe will automatically be built
on the next run. But I'm sure you know what incremental make
means.

Hello Pritpal,

I am learning WVG. So far so good :) And hope to convert all my
xHarbour+gtwvt codes into it!!!

Now I have some questions about it?

1) Is there any rgb() function?
2) Maximize/Restore command is not working properly.
3) Is WVG an open source library?

TIA.

With best regards.

Sudip

Thank you.
Also quite messy functionality :(. Dunno if we support such in any
way in Harbour, and I'm not convinced we should, as it looks like
a very dirty hack which allows to reach behind the hash concept.
Looks strange to me to use slot ordinals to reach hash members,
as the point of hashes is to hide this. At least IMO.

Brgds,
Viktor

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    * Changed to put user supplied lib to the beginning of the lib 
      list. This should fix situations where user lib is overriding 
      some Harbour objects (like getsys).
    + Added internal switch to enable simple -inc debug.
    ! Fixed to add .prg extension for Harbour input files when
      checking their timestamp, so files passed without extension 
      will now work in -inc mode.

Please recheck now.
I've just finished testing my local project with new hbmk2 -inc
functionality
and after setting up .hbm files, they beautifully work for all
compilers (and
also platforms, but I've yet to try). Thus replacing my local mesh of .sh,
GNU Make and GCC/BCC/MSVC make files for all platforms. This will
mean 1 file per project to keep and maintain.

Similarly, 3rd party Harbour developers may use hbmk2 as their portable
make system. At least for Harbour builds.

Brdgs,
Viktor

correct
hbmk2 test1.prg -inc
hbmk: Processing configuration: c:\harbour\mingw\bin\hbmk.cfg
hbmk: Target up to date: test1.exe


Works right also in library creation
hbmk2 delta.prg ACHOICE.PRG APPEND_D.PRG BOTTON_D.PRG CALCOL_
D.PRG COLOR_D.PRG DEFOPT.PRG EDIDUP_D.PRG EDITA2_D.PRG EDITAR_D.PRG  ERROR_D.PRG

RIG_D.PRG VALID_D.PRG VARIE_D.PRG VISTA2_D.PRG WORDPR_D.PRG  -b -m -D__GTWVT__
-hblib -odelta4hhd.lib -info -trace -inc
hbmk: Using Harbour: c:\harbour\mingw\bin c:\harbour\mingw\include c:\harbour\mi
ngw\lib c:\harbour\mingw\lib
hbmk: Processing configuration: c:\harbour\mingw\bin\hbmk.cfg
hbmk: Target up to date: libdelta4hhd.a

I have same question
hbmk incremental process must/will know also if a lib was updated?
if same library is created (for example) with and without debug  can i
set diferent path for incremental?

It will only know if someone implements this, it's in the TODO, but
I see it quite problematic to solve in a generic way. I'll keep this in
mind, maybe in the future I'll make some steps in this direction, but
for now I'm happy with this stage.

Your next question might be: "will it automatically rebuild if an included
header is rebuilt?". Same thing applies, but I'm even less interested
for now. Such mechanism is easy to tackle onto current logic, given
someone writes such source parsing header following code.

Yes, see -workdir: option.

Since debug/release is a common thing, maybe we can extend default
work dir with this information. We will see, first lets see if basics work.

Brgds,
Viktor

We have lots of places for feedback in our sf.net page if someone wants to
stay anonymous, and they now can even post messages
without subscribing to the list. We've been here a few month ago
with a similar proposed site.

Having more input channels won't boost the amount of input.

A release probably would.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

I'm trying to compile as you said, I want to inform the LIB, which builds up
until the end but when I open the system he's a GPF to start.
Since the same system using hbmake.exe of xharbour it compiles without
problems both with the version 1.0.0 as the latest version 1.2.0.
What I find is that this hbmk2.exe linking several LIB I'm not telling.
Below I am trying to compile for last:

FILE sagi.hbp
libpaths=d:\devel\hb-bcc\lib
libs=hbpcre hbvm hbmisc hbrtl gtgui hbpp hblang hbmacro hbcommon hbcpage
hbrdd rddntx rddcdx rddfpt hwgui procmisc hbmzip hbziparc hbct hbtip hbwin
xhb version
gt=gtgui
gui=yes
mt=no
nulrdd=no
debug=no
map=no
run=no
comp=bcc
autodetect=no

FILE comp.bat
hbmk2 -inc -st -trace SAGI.PRG ATUALIZA.PRG BALANCAS.PRG BALV_LIQUIDO.PRG
BAL_LIQUIDO.PRG BRUTO_ENT.PRG BRUTO_SAI.PRG CADASTROS.PRG CLIENTES.PRG

REL_GUI.PRG ROTINA.PRG UTEIS.PRG SYGECOM.PRG TRANSP_GUI.PRG USUARIOS.PRG

And below is what appears at the end of this compilation:

Turbo Incremental Link 5.00 Copyright (c) 1997, 2000 Borland

I'm trying to compile using the SVN version compiled days 04/13/2009 at
12:53 ( Harbour 1.1.0Dev (Rev. 10777) )

If you compile a sample of the pulp samples hwgui the same thing happens, I
tried to compile the example \hwgui\samples\all\a.prg using the command
below:
hbmk2 -l hwgui.lib -l procmisc.lib a.prg

He creates the executable file A. EXE, but when it will open the executable
of a GPF.

I appreciate any hint.
Thanks
Leonardo Machado

Most of the lines here aren't need, some of them aren't working, and the
rest is setting the default (see my comment above). First please try with
this minimal version:
--- sagi.hbp
libs=hwgui procmisc hbmzip hbziparc hbct hbtip hbwin version
gt=gtgui
---

hbmk2 tries to make life simple, so it will automatically add Harbour
libraries for you, this is normal and shouldn't cause breakage for
Harbour apps. You don't need to deal with these libs when using hbmk2,
except for contribs and 3rd party ones.

Current rev is 10855 and -inc is only supported since yesterday,
if you can, update your version and rebuild, you seem to be using
a mixture of different Harbour versions.

-l and libname shouldn't have a space in between, .lib extension is also not
needed:
hbmk2 -lhwgui -lprocmisc a.prg
(anyhow these libs are already specified in the .hbp file,
so there is no need to pass them on the command line)

I'll commit a few fixes for bcc targeting your GPF, but I have
to make some tests first.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

Update the harbor to the SVN using the command -INC.
And I try again the sample of A.PRG folder \HWGUI\SAMPLES\ALL\ but without
the extension. LIB and occurred the same problem, until he creates the EXE
but when it will open in a GPF.

Also compiled my system with the minimum settings as you stated and I
created the EXE without error in the compilation, but when it will open the
EXE of the GPF also.

Well, I try to compile using other compilers such as MSVC or MinGW.
This dabdo that the GPF is the BCC 5.5.1. I also try to Bcc 5.82.

Thank you for your attention.
Leonardo Machado

Hello

>I am learning WVG. So far so good :) And hope to convert all my
xHarbour+gtwvt codes into it!!!

:-)

>1) Is there any rgb() function?

Perhaps RGB macro is there instead of function.
If you do not find it then:
Function rgb( r,g,b )
   RETURN ( r + ( g*256 ) + ( b*256*256 ) )

>2) Maximize/Restore command is not working properly.

There is no RESTRORE command in WVG, what you are referring to ?

>3) Is WVG an open source library?

100%. Download Harbour SVN tree. It is located in harbour/contrib/gtwvg.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

Hi Viktor,

It worked, now compiled the example of A. PRG SAMPLES folder and compiled my
system too, but this opens a screen behind the MS-DOS system. I had already
seen a hint to avoid this screen but do not remember how to proceed, you
have any tips to eliminate this black screen MS-DOS that opening with my
application?

Thanks for the correction hbmk2

Hello Pritpal,

Thanks a lot for your answer.

So, I can use Rgb() (macro or function) same way I used in gtwvw. :-)

I used Wvt_ShowWindow( SW_RESTORE )

I want to run my program maximized. Is it possible?

Regarding open source, I found some wrong information in xHarbour group. ;-)
Now I am very happy.

Thank  you again.

With best regards.

Sudip

Try with -gtgui switch. For some reason though (I've checked and hwgui lib
requests gtnul), for me all hwgui samples work without it with recent
default
Harbour build and latest hwgui CVS:

> bcc55 C:\harbour-11\bin\hbmk2 -IC:\work\hwgui\include -LC:\work\hwgui\lib
hwgui.hbp grid_5.prg

You can find hwgui.hbp in utils/hbmk2/example dir.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello

>I used Wvt_ShowWindow( SW_RESTORE )

It is ok though you should use 

#include "hbgtwvg.ch"

hb_gtInfo( HB_GTI_SPEC, HB_GTS_WNDSTATE, HB_GTS_WS_NORMAL )

>I want to run my program maximized. Is it possible?

hb_gtInfo( HB_GTI_SPEC, HB_GTS_WNDSTATE, HB_GTS_WS_MAXIMIZED )

Regards

Hello Viktor,
I remember when this happened was in hbmake in xharbour only remove the
GTWIN.LIB compilation that solve the problem. So you ask, how do I remove
the GTWIN.LIB of my collection using hbmk2.exe to see if it solves the
problem of the MS-DOS screen open with my application? or have any option
for the command line to force a LIB to be linked? for example:

hbmk2 -lhwgui -lprocmisc -del GTWIN a.prg

Hello,

Thanks a lot. 
Sorry to disturb you so much.
When I use
hb_gtInfo( HB_GTI_SPEC, HB_GTS_WNDSTATE, HB_GTS_WS_MAXIMIZED )

Program window becomes large but not full screen (I am using with wide
screen labtop)

Regards.

Sudip

Removing gtwin is wrong concept, not proper solution.

Please try my just committed fix and report your results.

Hi Viktor,

Perfect right now compiled without error, with and without GPF BLACK SCREEN
OF MS-DOS.
Thank you very much.
Now I have a different problem with SET DEVICE TO PRINT, but I will open a
new topic even not to mix with that.
Again thank you.

Message-ID: <23045136.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello to All,

If I compile the example below with it's harbour an error in the SET DEVICE
TO PRINT, but reverse and put the SET DEVICE TO PRINT after the SET PRINT TO
"c: \ my_file.txt" there's not a mistake, but I have thousands routines that
are well and in whatever order xharbour it compiles and runs without errors.
Do you have any tips on how to resolve this without having to change all my
routines one by one?

***********
Function MAIN
***********
SET DEVICE TO PRINT
set print to "c:\my_file.txt"

@ PROW()+1,00  say CHR(15)

@ PROW()+1,01     say "TESTE DE IMPRESSAO LINHA 01"
@ prow(),pcol()+2 say "AINDA NA MESMA LINHA TESTE DE IMPRESSAO LINHA 01"
@ prow()+3,02     say " ______________________________ "
@ prow()+1,02     say " Gerente de Compra.:"

SET PRINTER TO
set device to screen

*EDICAO("c:\my_file.txt")  // FEATURE THAT SHOWS IN THE SCREEN generated
file

RETURN


The error that is giving the Harbour:
Error TERM/2014  Erro de cria??o: LPT1 (DOS Error 2)

It is because in WVT|WVG fonts are set calculating the 
desktop size / console rows * font height
and width is set accordingly. 

There is no way to scale the fonts to windows exact width and height.

Which font you are using? "Courier New" is the best font to scale 
to a greater degree.

Pritpal Bedi

Hello,

I come here to learn wvg.

I don't want to "fight" against anybody. :-)

Yes, I heard some words about Vouch. And regarding vouch I heard Pritpal's
name.
This may be my "fault" to think wvg and vouch same way.

And I shall never say whose message was this. Because everybody has right to
express his idea. If it is good I shall accept it and if it is bad I shall
reject it.

And I don't want to discuss this topics farther. Because it has no relation
with my learning. :-)

With best regards.

Sudip

Hello,

Thanks a lot. It's now clear to me.

Hello to All,

If you compile the example \harbour\contrib\hbtip\tests\dnldftp.prg with BCC

Looks like an incompatibility with Clipper, which also works okay in this
situation. I don't know how to fix it though.

First of sorry for the post, but I'm moving to Harbour, I'm full of

Everybody is welcome. Group will be more than glad to respond you.

asc( cCharacter ) == chr( 13 )

Does not it looks weired. 
How you can compare NUMERIC with CHARCATER?
You could have compared it as : cCharacter == chr( 13 ).
Did you check it with Clipper ?

NOTE: In xHarbour ONE character string is treated as a number 
so you were able to compare as above. I know that in C it works like
it is implemented in xHarbour but we are accustomed to the language
CLIPPER. 

Now I know that in one of projects under my supervision blow up randomely
and error log always report that comparison operands are not of same 
type. 

Hope you may be clear now.

BTW there is some compiler switch in Harbour which mimmics this behaviour.
correct and complete me if right ...

Pritpal Bedi

Thanks for the explanation.

I was using gnu make 3.80.

Now compiler goes...

Hi Pritpal Bedi,
Ok, thank you for explanation. I thought that was compatible xharbour with
Harbour and Harbour with xHarbour.
Solved the problem by modifying the function Open_Word, leaving as below:

*****************************
Function Open_word( cArquivo )
*****************************
local cArqRtf, arq , cHandle
local cCaractere  := space( 01 )
local cLinha      := space( 01 )
local lf          := chr( 13 ) + chr( 10 )

cArqRtf  := lower( left( cArquivo, len( cArquivo ) - 4 ) + ".doc" )
arq      := fcreate( cArqRtf, 1 )
cHandle  :=
"{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\deff0\deflang1046{\fonttbl{\f0\fmodern\fprq1\fcharset0
Courier New;}{\f1\fswiss\fcharset0 Arial;}}" + lf
cHandle  += "\margl284\margr505\margt505\margb505" + lf

cHandle  += "{\*\generator Msftedit
5.41.15.1503;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs14 "
fwrite( arq, cHandle )

cText := memoread( cArquivo )
for nA := 1 to mlcount( cText, 150 )
  cCaractere := memoline( cText, 150, nA, 1, .F. )
  cCaractere  += "\par" + lf
  fwrite( arq, cCaractere )
NEXT
cHandle  := "}"
fwrite( arq, cHandle )
fclose( arq          )

*Open_arquivo( cArqRtf )
Return( .T. )
***************

Exactly, this is one of those weird features (hidden extension) of xhb. I
can only suggest to clean such code to "Asc( c ) == 13". This code
works with all existing xbase dialects, has the same speed, easier to
type, easier to read, so you will only win. The real task is to find such
lines in code.

I don't think this feature is supported even by linking xhb lib.

Brgds,
Viktor

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + libpaths= can now have relative paths specified, and in this
      case the path will be adjusted by absolute path of host .hbp.
      This makes it possible to point hbmk2 to a .hbp file in a
      foreign dir, and let it pick up local lib dirs automatically.
    + .hbp files passed without absolute paths will now inherit
      the .hbm path if applicable.
    + Will now echo all explicitly specified .hbp filenames on
      screen in -info mode.
    + Added echo= support in .hbp files. The parameter will be 
      echoed to stdout as is.
    + Added macro support for following .hbp lines:
      libpaths=, prgflags=, cflags=, ldflags=, echo=.
      Supported macros are:
      ${hb_root}: hbmk2 base dir
      ${hb_parent}: .hbp file dir
      ${hb_arch}: architecture
      ${hb_comp}: compiler
      ${<envvar>}: any envvar
    + .hbp files are now searched in libpaths, too.
    ; NOTE: With above changes it's possible to refer to a 3rd
            party lib solely by pointing to its .hbp file, from
            that point all lib/include paths can be automatically
            picked up. Here's an example for hwgui, the file
            needs to be places in hwgui root dir:
            ---
            {win}prgflags=-i${hb_parent}include
            {win}cflags=-I${hb_parent}include
            {win}libpaths=${hb_parent}lib
            {win}libs=hwgui hwg_qhtm procmisc hbxml
            {win}gt=gtgui
            ---
            Any hwgui apps can be compiled with this command:
            hbmk2 appname.prg C:\hwgui\hwgui.hbp

Hi Rodrigo,

Sorry I test now .-

gcc -v --help > gcc_help.txt

And I think that it's not necessary to remove -lgtwin.
You tried to add the option -mwindows "Create GUI application" .-

gcc obj/demo.o -o bin/demogtk.exe -L/harbour/lib -L../../lib *-mwindows*
-Wl,--start-group -lxhgtk  -lhbdebug -lhbvm -lhbrtl -lhbrdd -lhbrtl
-lhbvm -lhbmacro -lhbpp -lhblang -lhbcpage -lhbcommon -lrddntx
-lrddcdx -lrddfpt -lhbsix -lhbhsx -lgtgui -lgtwin -Wl,--end-group -lm
-luser32 -lwinspool -lole32 -loleaut32 -luuid -lgdi32 -lcomctl32
-lcomdlg32 -lodbc32 `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0`

and

Procedure HB_GtSys()
    HB_GT_GUI_DEFAULT()
return

Hi Viktor,
In this last change in \ harbor \ contrib \ hbtip \ DNLDFTP.PRG realized
that instead of PROCEDURE is PROCDURE.
And if you have any tips on how to resolve the error that is giving to this
example I would too.

Great job Viktor,

Thanks.
When compiling parallel multithreaded ?  ;)
New option: -j [N], --jobs[=N] Allow N jobs at once; infinite jobs with no arg.

Hi Leonardo,
Thanks. As for the error, a quick check lead to
url.prg, but I don't know this code (especially the
many regexp tricks there), so I hope someone
who does will be able to check it and fix it.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

OK, I noticed that the HB_SENDMAIL () also gives this error. At the moment I
try to change the sending of email to use with the CONTRIB Blat, and later I
see on the FTP.
Already decided rather compatibility between the xHarbour Harbour and on my
system with the help of you here at the Harbour Group.

Hi,
I've rechecked the logs and there weren't many changes in hbtip
this last year which could cause such error, so it must be an older
issue. For me though sending e-mails via hbtip works properly,
I've just rechecked.

Brgds,
Viktor

Thanks Xavi.
Parallel compiling? Well, good idea actually :)

It could be done, but I'm not familiar with MT programming
(just concepts about coding *for* MT). The way to
do it is most probably to split filelists into N chunks
and launch these commands in separate threads and
wait for them to complete before going to next make
stage. A bit more gymnastics is needed for command
which we are executing in a loop, where the whole loops
has to be moved to thread.

If someone has working code for this, it'd be welcome.

[ one minor: I cannot interpret 'infinite' number of jobs. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

It is tested with MinGW and XP.
I will be looking for input on different platforms and/or compilers.

I have a small application in console mode with pure clipper, I 
understand that I can make it look like QT application in a graphical 
mode (GUI), or am I wrong.
How can I use QT?
What should I add in my application?

TIA

I know about it but fmstat also does not work for harbour.dll.

Personally in current days I do not find this module as very usable.
I need it only in some special cases when I can recompile whole Harbour
code. I strongly prefer to use valgrind memory reports and for them
any additional code may only hide some important information reported
by valgrind. F.e. it automatically detects accessing memory before/after
the allocated block and our FM stat module effectively disables such
reports due to additional allocated memory.
The one interesting functionality provided by this module are user reports
about leaks in some seldom used code which can be later validated by
developers with more precise devices. But if sth is not enabled by default
then we do not have such reports.

Hi Guliemo
i post a reply for that that i have know, accept my partial I reply

The basic tool is qt
Qt is a cross-platform application development framework, widely used
for the development of GUI programs, and also used for developing
non-GUI programs such as console tools and servers. Qt is most notably
used in KDE, Opera, Google Earth, Skype, Qt Extended, Adobe Photoshop
Album, VirtualBox and OPIE. It is produced by the Norwegian company Qt
Software, formerly known as Trolltech, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Nokia since June 17, 2008.

HBQT.LIB (near completed) implement a basic qt primitive and require
writing gui code from scratch. See how in blog of  one of Author of
hbqt Marcos Gambeta
http://www.magsoftinfo.com.br/blog/

GTQTC.LIB (working) Implement the CUI so you can use qt with your
console application simply add same row and linking this gt.
Final application is console application based on qt
see contrib\gtqtc\test\demoqtc.prg for better understand and
gtqtc.lib is compatible with gtwvt so you can also verify the gtwvt
version c:\harbour\tests\wvwtext.prg

GTQTG.LIB  (not jet implemented) Implement Hibrid CUI/GUI. Existing
program will run with very little modification and will be extended
using GUI command
Final application is Gui with a console application
gtqtc will be highly compatible with actual contriv gtwvg
an Xbase++ compatible class will be used for having a portable syntax
between different gui
a gtwvw compatible syntax will be done

It's not like in C and never was. I do not understand why Ron is repeated
that it tries to mimic C because it's not true.
In C you cannot make:
   "A" == 65
You can only use special operator to extract character value as
number be enclosing it in ''. But it's not a one byte string. It's
numeric value written in special way. Just like any number starting with
0x is hexadecimal number or any number starting with 0 is octal number.
So xHarbour is not even close to any C rules in the above.
This extension is local to xHarbour and does not exists in other languages
I know.
If you want to make sth close to C then it should be bound with [] operator
used for string, f.e. you can make in C:
   "ABC"[1]
and it returns numeric value equal to "B" character representation.
So in Harbour it should return number, f.e.:
   ? ABC[2] // 66 on ASCII based machines
or:
   s := "ABC"
   s[2] := 42
   ? s      // "A*C"

In the past Harbour had such extension added by Ryszard and it was
working quite well without anomalies which have to appear in xHarbour
like implementations which operates on one byte strings not numbers
like C or the old Harbour code, f.e. this code:
   x:="ABC"
   ? x[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
will not generate any RT error because 1 is always valid string but
also this code:
   porc main
      local x:="ABC"
      ? x[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,-1,2,3-0-4,5,-0x1234465abc]
   return
will not generate any RT error because in xHarbour [] operator used for
strings try to mimic substr() behavior. It means the if user have multi
dimensional array or hash array and then by mistake will overwrite one
of its items by string then xHarbour VM will accept any stupid indexes
for this string without any RT error. In the past when I was working
with xHarbour I made such mistake twice and it cost me a lot of time
to locate the real reason of problem.

You can use -ks and then overload [] used for string.
You can also overload all other operators using scalar classes.
In XHB library we _Character and _Numeric classes which emulates
xHarbour behavior but I added only arithmetic operators (+, -, *, ...)
without any relational ones (==, =, <, ...). I'll add them in some spare
time or user can easy make it yourself.
But I suggest to rather clean the code then use such things.

Przemek

Exactly. This is what I was trying to explain.

>But I suggest to rather clean the code then use such things.

That appln when compiled with xHarbour blows up. 
With Harbour it just runs fine.

Personaly I do not like to use string as array of numbers though.

Thanks for the detailed explanation, it will reduce queries on this subject.

Hi Pritpal!

I have followed their work using hbQt and I think it is great!
In my personal tests here, I developed a  ALERT() function ... I would
send you in the hope of contributing to the project, I will be
grateful if you can consider:

#include <QMessageBox>

/*
 * ALERT() function basead on QT MessageBox. By Vailton Renato
<vailtom@gmail.com>
 * Syntax: Alert( <xText>, [<aOptions>|<cOption>], [<xTitle>],
[<nIcon>] ) -> nSelectedOption
 * 15/04/2009 - 09:47:01
 */
HB_FUNC( ALERT )
{
 QString text;
 QMessageBox  msgBox;
 QList<QAbstractButton *> btnList;

 char *szText;
 PHB_ITEM pItem;
 BOOL fFree;
 ULONG ulSize, ulLen, ul;

 /* Text of window .. */
 if (!HB_ISNIL(1))
 {
   szText = hb_itemString( hb_param( 1, HB_IT_ANY ), &ulLen, &fFree );
   if (ulLen)
     text.append( szText );
   if( fFree )
     hb_xfree( szText );
 }

 if (text.isEmpty())
 {
   hb_retni(0);
   return;
 }

 text.replace( ';', '\n' );

 if (ISARRAY(2))
 {
   pItem  = hb_param( 2, HB_IT_ARRAY );
   ulSize = hb_arrayLen( pItem );

   for( ul = 1; ul <= ulSize; ++ul )
   {
      szText = hb_itemString( hb_arrayGetItemPtr( pItem, ul ), &ulLen,
&fFree );
      if (ulLen)
         btnList << msgBox.addButton( szText, QMessageBox::ActionRole );
      if( fFree )
         hb_xfree( szText );
   }
 } else {
   if (!HB_ISNIL(2))
   {
      szText = hb_itemString( hb_param( 2, HB_IT_ANY ), &ulLen, &fFree );

      if (ulLen)
         btnList << msgBox.addButton( szText, QMessageBox::ActionRole );
      if( fFree )
         hb_xfree( szText );
   }
 }

 if (btnList.isEmpty())
    btnList << msgBox.addButton( QMessageBox::Ok );	

 /* Title of window */
  if (!HB_ISNIL(3))
 {
   szText = hb_itemString( hb_param( 3, HB_IT_ANY ), &ulLen, &fFree );
   if (ulLen)
      msgBox.setWindowTitle( szText );
   if( fFree )
      hb_xfree( szText );
 }

 if (ISNUM(4))
 {
   int nIcon = hb_parni(4);

   if ((nIcon >= 0) && (nIcon <= 4 ))
      msgBox.setIcon( QMessageBox::Icon( nIcon ) );
 }

 msgBox.setTextFormat( Qt::PlainText );
 msgBox.setText( text );
 msgBox.exec();

 hb_retni( btnList.indexOf( msgBox.clickedButton() ) +1 );
}


I would appreciate any comments!

Hello Viktor,
If not bothered, that would be put as an sample of use of HB_SENDMAIL in the
\CONTRIB\HBTIP\TESTS that I can compile using hbmk2.exe.
Here is giving error in everything related to HBTIP.LIB. I am using the BCC
5.5.1 for now to compile the samples.

I'll try but I will need a little bit more time to make it
well and this is a problem for me now. I'm really busy with
some other jobs - sorry.
I looked at this code and as I can see you adopted GTWVT but
with the WVT code it inherited some Windows only declarations
too, f.e.:

../../gtqtc.h:255: error: COLORREF does not name a type
../../gtqtc.h:262: error: POINT does not name a type
../../gtqtc.h:270: error: POINT does not name a type
../../gtqtc.h:277: error: LF_FACESIZE was not declared in this scope
../../gtqtc.h:279: error: HWND does not name a type
../../gtqtc.h:286: error: HICON does not name a type
../../gtqtc.h:306: error: RECT does not name a type
../../gtqtc.h:307: error: RECT does not name a type
../../gtqtc.cpp:111: error: TCHAR does not name a type
../../gtqtc.cpp:121: error: LRESULT does not name a type
../../gtqtc.cpp:127: error: HWND was not declared in this scope

and it blocks compilation on non Windows platforms.
I do not know QT enough to make such modification by hand and
so far I haven't found time to ready current Qt documentation.
Many years ago I read some old one but a lot of things has been
changed in last years.
If I find some spare time I try to help but now I cannot give
you any deadline. Sorry.

Hi All:

Pls note that in Xbase++ you can use a string ans if it was an array of 
chars.
eg:   cString := 'abc'
       ? cString[2]   --->  'b'
       ? cString[-1]  --->  'c'

Another very usefull feature is the 3rd parameter in:
At( <cSubString>, <cString> [,<nStartPos>] ) --> nPosition

In Harbour you can implement such functionality yourself if you only want.
Below is small code which uses xHarbour like implementation from XHB.LIB
activated by request XHB_LIB.
Just try.
But if you want you can create your own with different semantic.

> Another very usefull feature is the 3rd parameter in:

In Harbour such functionality has HB_AT() function.
Changing standard xbase functions parameters is not good idea in
our opinion because it may create problems when data is exchanged
between programs compiled by different languages or using some common
low level database system, f.e. the fact that xbase++ has 3-rd parameter
in AT() function does not cause that it will be accepted by ADS based
RDDs which also have AT() function and it can be used in some expressions.
To avoid confusion we decided to add new functions instead of changing
existing Clipper/dbase ones.

best regards,
Przemek

Hi Massimo,
	
Save the code below into a file. Test.prg PRG into the folder called \
harbor \ contrib \ hbtip \ tests \ and compiled using hbmk2.exe. By
generating the executable without error, but when I run it generates the
following error:

Error BASE/1081  Operation not supported: TIPCLIENTSMTP:new()
Called from TIPCLIENT:NEW(0)
Called from TIPCLIENTSMTP:NEW(0)
Called from HB_SENDMAIL(0)
Called from MAIN(9)
***

o codigo usado no test.prg ?:
cServerIP="smtp.mydomain.com"
cFrom="mymail@myserver.com.br"
cUserName="myusername"
cPassword="mypassword"
aTo="leonardo@sygecom.com.br"
cSubject="Hello Bill"
cMsg="Can you join to harbour project?"
HB_SendMail(cServerIP,,cFrom,aTo,,,cMsg,cSubject,,cUserName,cPassword,cServerIP,,.f.,.f.,.f.)
*****

I am using the current version of the harbour and I am compiling SVN 5.5.1
with BCC, do you have any tips on how to solve this problem?

Note: In xHarbour am able to use the HB_SENDMAIL () without problems.

I will clean the Windows specific stuff within a day-or-two.

Take your own time. I was just asking for expert opinion 
about the structure of the GTQTC.C, I mean the way I implemented 
C++ classes and their interaction with pure C code.

I will do the rest.

It seems to be a good replacement of Alert() in GUI mode.
I will include it in upcoming Xbase++ compatible hbqtxbp.lib and 
gtqtg.lib with GUI interface. 

hbqt.lib is a pure wrapper library for QT base API callable
from PRG code. And in gtqtc.lib Alert() replacement do not 
makeup base criteria.

In the meantime please work on AChoice() replacement too.

Hi Massimo,

Even I put the information correctly when it generates the error you posted
earlier.
I would say that this xHarbour in compiling and running perfectly.
	
Is the problem only occurs using the BCC 5.5.1?

Subject: [Harbour] QT - HBQT - Remaining Classes - Any Volunteer ?
Message-ID: <23062092.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

I am looking for someone who could 
pullout class information and put it in 
corresponding .qth, sectionized as per 
.qth specifications ?

You should only create .qth file, do not include
its definition in .qtp.

Please respond if you understand the concept 
properly and please do not ask how to .

I would like to concentrate on gtqtc | Xbp*Parts | gtqtg.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

Even in dynamic mode we could keep current default settings
(on for default build, off for releases/mpkg builds).

So what to do? Remove this feature or switch to dynamic with
compatible defaults? (is it doable at all to control it via
hbfmstat / hbfmnostat libs?

[ Personally, I practically never do a build with fm stats on,
but the feature could be useful to do leak tests (even on the
field) after adding new .c functionality or after experiencing
strange behaviour / leak suspect. Currently I'm not using
it though, and it's probably better to valgrind every new
.c module. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

I've found it. BCC has it's own PCRE in it's RTL lib, and
hbmk2 (after recent change when switching to separate
link command) is including it before hbpcre, making it
the default PCRE engine. The BCC PCRE engine apparently
cannot handle regexp needs is hbtip.

I'll fix it ASAP.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

Thank you,
Solved the problem of HB_SENDMAIL () and FTP.
For MENEN now is not giving more hbtip.lib error in the class, I tested the
FTP and the sending and receiving transfers everything correctly. Now I just
try to see if the sending and receiving e-mails.
Again thanks for your help.

Hello Viktor,

I, tested the FTP and all this 100%. Now the hb_sendmail () this always
returns false, I am using all the parameters correctly, even did a test by
sending xHarbour and correctly.
Do have any tips for that little problem?

Hi Viktor,
I appeared another problem with FTP, I had forgotten to test a module which
has the following line:

cByts : = oClient: filesize (cNAME_FILE)

This returns the file size that will download via FTP, and when it reaches
this line giving the error below:

Error BASE/1004  Message not found: TIPCLIENTFTP:HB_FSIZE
Called from ->__ERRRT_SBASE(0)
Called from ../../tobject.prg->TIPCLIENTFTP:ERROR(0)
Called from ../../tobject.prg->(b)HBOBJECT(0)
Called from ../../tobject.prg->TIPCLIENTFTP:MSGNOTFOUND(0)
Called from ../../tobject.prg->TIPCLIENTFTP:HB_FSIZE(0)
****

Note: If you need a complete example can produce and post here to simulate
the error.

Subject: [Harbour] Problem with COPY FILE
Message-ID: <23064665.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello to all,

In xHarbour I have used as below to copy DBF files from one folder to
another: 
__CopyFile("DADOS\NAME_FILE1.DBF","DADOS\NAME_FILE2.DBF")

Only Harbour in the same command that gives the error on that line, when
solved by putting the full path of the DBF file example:

__CopyFile("C:\MYSIS\DADOS\NAME_FILE1.DBF","C:\MYSIS\DADOS\NAME_FILE2.DBF")

But ask the Harbour should not automatically get that neither the xharbour
the full path of the file?

Subject: [Harbour] QT - Add-On Library
Message-ID: <23065307.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

I propose to setup 
harbour/contrib/hbqtadd ( or with better name )
which will compile to hbqtadd.lib

OBJECTIVE
========
To accuulate all standalone widgets which can be used in 
end user applications, just like Renauto's Alert() he 
posted a few messages back.

RULES
====
1. The function must adhere to Harbour coding and formatting styles.
2. The function must use either QT's API on C level or hbqt.lib on PRG
level.
3. The function must pe prefixed by "QTA_" ( or better name ) [ QTA_Alert()
].
4. All other supporting functions must be file-wide statics.
5. The function just receive PRG level parameters and return a value, if
needed.

This way we will have a wealth of functions to integrate with base
GTQTC | GTQTG | HBQTXBP when those will be ready.

If accepted please post first contribution by Renauto to this lib.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

Hi Vailton,
Yes, everything is correct, xHarbour with this is that this error does not
happen.
And it also happens when you tell the full path of the file.
I found the Harbour could have some SET setting this problem.

--------------------------------------------------
What part doesn't work?  I have never used MinGW, so I do not have specific
knowledge there.  But maybe if you indicate what error you are seeing, we
can provide some direction.  Do the tools give an error?  Is the .def file
invalid?  Or is the resulting lib file invalid in some way?  I don't think
ACE32.DLL has any unusual properties.  It is simply Win32 DLL with a bunch
of exported functions.  I would assume you have looked at the following
page, but if not, maybe it will provide some help:
http://oldwiki.mingw.org/index.php/CreateImportLibraries.

Hi Leonardo,
You seem to be using hbcompat.ch and it messes up this line of yours:
cByts : = oClient: filesize (cNAME_FILE)
by changing 'filesize' to 'hb_fsize'. Formatting the line to
cByts := oClient:filesize(cNAME_FILE)
may help, if not, make sure not to use hbcompat.ch in this source.

Brgds,
Viktor

I suggest to gather these misc parts until we have more than one such addons
and we can see a bit better what we
are dealing with exactly. An 'addon' scheme needs some
planning IMO before we commit things to the SVN.

I see we're running in too many directions already with QT
related things.

I feel an alternate Alert() is a perfect part of GTQTG, but I
cannot see a place for it in other places with this name.
With a different name, it can be a start for a higher level QT
layer, similar (in fact an alternative) to hbxbp, but it's too
early to form a concept based on one function ;)

Brgds,
Viktor

FWIW, your line (with locally existing files) works on my system without
error (tried with BCC).
You didn't post the error you're getting.

I also feel the heat. But these paths are natural, IMO.
We need to devise a roadpath.

Valid assertion.
Renato, and all, please publish all your function here in this thread only.
Also all your Alert() function in this thread replying to first message
and changing <Subject> as QT - ADDON - Alert().
It will help to keep track of all such functions once other 
parts are in place.

Hi Ranier,
The way to post large files is to upload it somewhere and post a link.

MSVC compiler has lots of known warnings waiting a future cleanup,
we're using -W4 warning level which is quite picky.

You can override to -W3 to get a "clean" output.
set HB_USER_CFLAGS=-W3

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Pritpal!

I have followed their work using hbQt and I think it is great!
In my personal tests here, I developed a ?ALERT() function ... I would
send you in the hope of contributing to the project, I will be
grateful if you can consider:

#include <QMessageBox>

HB_FUNC( ALERT )
{
?QString text;
?QMessageBox ?msgBox;
?QList<QAbstractButton *> btnList;

?char *szText;
?PHB_ITEM pItem;
?BOOL fFree;
?ULONG ulSize, ulLen, ul;

?/* Text of window .. */
?if (!HB_ISNIL(1))
?{

? if (ulLen)
? ? text.append( szText );
? if( fFree )
? ? hb_xfree( szText );
?}

?if (text.isEmpty())
?{
? hb_retni(0);
? return;
?}

?text.replace( ';', '\n' );

?if (ISARRAY(2))
?{

? ? ?if (ulLen)

?msgBox.setText( text );
?msgBox.exec();

?hb_retni( btnList.indexOf( msgBox.clickedButton() ) +1 );
}


I would appreciate any comments!

I wish to club all such contributions in one thread
and which I wished to be the current one replying to
root message.

Anyhow it is ok, I will manage.

Hi Viktor,

Actually, it was just taking out the hbcompat.ch which solved the problem.
Again thanks for the tip I will try and pay more attention.

Hi Viktor,

Just to warn that if the hb_sendmail () changed to use with \ CONTRIB \
HBBLAT and it was resolved, alias was quicker to the sending of emails.
I will continue migrating to the Harbour, the only time I thank all the
assistance you have provided. Thank you.

    + Added -inc support for lib dependencies. This means that
      changed libs will also force a target rebuild.
      I've implemented three separate logic for mingw/cygwin,
      gcc/linux+sunos and the rest of compilers. This may not
      be precisely the way each of the hbmk2 supported compilers
      wotk, but it probably covers most cases. Anyhow please
      tweak and correct if you find some problems. I did
      tests with mingw, msvc, bcc static and shared mode.
    ! Removed automatic path tweak in .hbp/libpaths=.

Well done, that particular gotcha must have come up at least 10 times in the 
last 3 or 4 years.

Subject: [Harbour] QT - Few Unresolved Issues
Message-ID: <23072927.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello All

Here are some unresolved ( so far ) issues with QT:

1) How can width of fonts can be managed as in Windows ?

2) How to create and manage console caret ?

3) How to query keyboard states ?

I have tried tough on these solutions but have been 
failure so far. After these points are resolved, GTQTC will 
perfectly match with GTWVT.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added support for source file parsing for headers in -inc mode.
      .prg, .c and .rc files are currently parsed recursively,
      include paths will be scanned for included files. There are
      currently three levels of scanning: disabled, partial (default)
      and full. Partial will scan the first 16K of each source file
      for performance reasons, full will scan the complete files.
      The source parser is currently very simple; '#include "<filename>"'
      pattern is recognized anywhere in the processed source, no
      other variations are supported ATM. Using this format is IMO
      best practice for user programs, if someone needs more
      than this, it needs to be developed, current method is quite
      fast, which is important when dealing with lots of source
      files.
    + Added option to control header scanning: -[no]head=<mode>
      This is also supported in .hbp files.
    + Added support to look in current dir for libs for compilers
      where this is supported.
    + Added cmdline option -resflag=, .hbp option resflags= and
      overall support for user supplied resource compiler flags.
    + Added support for cyg*.dll style libs.
    ! Fixed to handle libs with explicit dirs for compilers
      where this is supported.

Below is output from current GTQTC compilation in Linux.

BTW in contrib/hbqt/hbqt.h[60] we have:
   #define QT_VERSION 0x040500
Is it necessary?
It causes that the following warning is generated for each hbqt file:
   In file included from ../../hbqt.h:62,
                    from ../../hbqt_*:??:
   /usr/include/Qt/qglobal.h:53:1: warning: "QT_VERSION" redefined

Thanks Vailton,

I think it can also be a good example of working with hbqt and I translated to prg.
Just as exercise of programming. :)
Is this wrong?

Well, we can switch to -Wall if that helps finding more potential problems in
Harbour.
Most of these warnings are known to me and I hope we can deal with it
as part of the introduction of (and switching to) our new Harbour types.
On many occasions such switch could solve these warnings much more
efficiently than just simply suppressing the error (= sweeping it under the
carpet) with an explicit cast. Look at the ULONG vs. long vs. size_t
problem for example. Or places where a given entity doesn't have a
well-defined int size along whole Harbour (GT row/col f.e.).

We have lots of additional similar warnings with msvc64 and we have
several type name collisions when using Harbour with certain tools
(FreeImage
and owatcom for example). There is a lot to do here, and it needs
contributors.

There are some warnings which I have no idea how to correct, like the
FARPROC conversion.

Anyhow I certainly hope we can clear these up in the future.

Brgds,
Viktor

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added support for wildcarded input files for Harbour,
      C, resource compiler and object input files.
      This also works in .hbm files. Note: You must specify
      the extension, so *.* won't work, but *.prg and *.c will.
      Use with care, as hbmk2 will pickup everything and this
      may not be what you want to do f.e. in our tests dirs,
      but it can be useful if you store source files belonging
      to the same project in one dir, or with some unique
      filename prefix.
      (some of these may be unnecessary on *nix platforms, where
      the shell does such expansion already, it's still useful
      though, as *nix users can also benefit from wildcard usage 
      inside .hbm files)

Thanks Xavi

I prefer the .prg  version =)
It's portable and we are clipperheads, aren`t we ?
It's also a good example of qt using from .prg code

  * harbour/contrib/gtqtc/gtqtc.cpp
  * harbour/contrib/gtqtc/gtqtc.h
    ! Fix to many unsuppoted defines on *nixes.
      Przemek, please compile again. Probably by now it will
      only 'WindowCloseButtonHint' error may appear. But reading
      the documents QT nowhere specifies that it is platform
      dependant member. Can you please comment out 
      #define QT_VERSION 0x040500 in hbqt.h and compile again.
      It is left-over residual.

  * harbour/source/vm/garbage.c
    + added optional support for automatic GC activation.
      It's not enabled by default yet but by compilation with macro
      HB_GC_AUTO, f.e. after setting envvar:
         set HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_GC_AUTO
      Automatic GC activation may be necessary for code which creates
      complex variables with cyclic references and does not execute
      any other code which may activate idle state GC call. It also
      makes unnecessary to explicitly call hb_gcAll() from user code,
      f.e. as some type of background task. If some of you were using
      code which needed such explicit GC activation then please remove
      it and make some tests with Harbour compiled with HB_GC_AUTO macro.

      This simple .prg code illustrates the problem. When linked with HVM
      without automatic GC it quite fast allocates all available memory
      and finished with out of memory error or is interrupted by OS.
      When automatic GC is enabled it can work unlimited time period
      with some fixed maximum memory usage.

            proc main()
               local a
               while .t.
                  a:={nil}
                  a[1]:=a
               enddo
            return

Hi Viktor,

Yes, the -Wall is my friend and has help quite!

The cost is big verbosity logs, IMO a low cost.

I?ve been searched about unsave conversion from 'FARPROC'  and the 
solution, apparently is

#pragma warning <http://0-www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.millennium.unicatt.it/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=warning>( disable : 4191 ) */// unsafe conversion from .../*

Ironic!

Thanks,
Best Regards

Ranier Vilela

Hi Przemek,

Thanks a lot for this.

FWH call hb_gcAll() when a dialog end. Can we use automatic GC
activation in FWH to avoid hb_gcAll() call ?

TIA an dbest regards,

Toninho.

Indeed :)

So we can add -wd4191 to our default options and forget about this.
But, I'm afraid this may disable also some valid cases, so...

I'll fix some of the macro problems, but the enum is false alarm, the code
logic
doesn't require to list all the values.

[...]

Such warnings should be generated _only_ when there is no 'default' case
in switch() statement.
For me it's MSVC bug.

i think that will be interesting a  xDevStudioHarbour special version with:
able  Read & write directly *.hbm
make Process based on hbmk2
and naturally English Version

xdevstudio give what that hbmk can't give
Syntax High Light, Code Completion
for having the productivity of edit-compile-run cicle
integrated debugger will be last interesting tool
will be intresting if harbour give capability of integrate debugger in
external editor
Here info about xdevstudio for user that not know it
http://www.sqllib.com.br/v4/index.php?artigo=xDevStudio

Yes, you can but single GC call bound with some user interaction should
not cause any noticeable speed overhead so it may not be worth to remove
hb_gcAll() from FWH code but I do not know how often 'dialog end' code
is activated and what it exactly means in FWH so I could be wrong and
it's sth vital for total FWH application performance.

Hello Przemek,

I include in my compilation of the flow "set HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_GC_AUTO",
down again harbour svn (10873) and generated again, but see the example
below: 

[CODE]
#include "hbmemory.ch"

      a:={nil} 
      a[1]:=a 
      tecla := inkey()
      if tecla = 27
         exit
      endif
*     hb_gcall()  && with the consumption of this memory is stabilized.
enddo 

return NIL

Harbor me when I'm compiling this line appears. She is right?

[CODE]

Harbour has native support for:
1. NTX with many extensions like multitag support (CTX is CLIP),
   automatic unique keys (CDX like key value normalization) or
   large file format (up to 4 TB).
   In practice all CDX/NSX features are supported.
2. CDX - only compressed compound indexes just like COMIX/CL53.
   It does not support single tag or uncompressed .IDX indexes.
   In practice all extensions and features are supported and many of
   them are unique to Harbour and does not exist in other RDDs.
3. NSX - with many extensions to SIX3 implementation which are
   common to Harbour NTX/CDX/NSX implementation.

Harbour does not support MDX or NDX indexes and I doubt that we can
find anyone interested in implementing them.
In current days it seems to be waste of time at least for me.

qApp->keyboardModifiers() did the trick.
Though it is not exactly calculate all artifacts but something is better

Subject: [Harbour] DBF to migrate from PostGreSQL
Message-ID: <23086388.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello to All,
With the help of colleagues here in the Forum managed to migrate from
xHarbour Harbor using the BCC 5.5.1, now my next step is to migrate from DBF
PostGreSQL, I took a look at the options available at Harbor that is:
The RDD SQLMIX, but is just one example of use in the \ CONTRIB \ RDDSQL \
Tests \.

I wonder how is this project of SQLMIX, if I can use it in production, and
where to find more examples.
I had a look at the \ CONTRIB \ HBPGSQL of Rodrigo Moreno, but rather
requires that I change my system to use it.

I think even the best alternative SQLMIX FREE, for compatibility with xbase
commands. If not the best way, what would be the best way to migrate from
DBF to PostGreSQL, with the minimum of changes to my sources they use today
DBFCDX.

I appreciate any hint.

Leonardo Machado

Hello Massimo,

Thanks for the tip, but I know the bill Sqllib execelente and I think a
project, but I'm looking for any alternative FREE, FREE version of Sqllib
and has no support for PostgreSQL. You have some other alternative?

Yes, but when the total memory usage reach some limit then GC is automatically
activated.
In my Linux box the maximal memory used (1002) reach 5793595 and
current memory usage is between ~200000 and 5793595.
The GC is automatically activated ~ once per 100000 loops.
F.e.:
    1001 = Memory used (bytes)                            436835
    1002 = Maximum memory used (bytes)                   5793595

This is expected behavior.
If your GT driver is slow and you have to wait long time for 100000
iterations then I suggest to use dispbegin()/dispend() in main loop, f.e.:

[...]
   while .t. 
         b += 1
         dispbegin()
         VER_MEMO()
         @22 , 01 say b
         dispend()
         a:={nil} 
         a[1]:=a 
[...]

It should give noticeable speed improvement.
You can also comment some lines VER_MEMO() and leave only:
   @11, 01 say "1001 = Memory used (bytes)                        " + str( memory( HB_MEM_USED        ) )
   @12, 01 say "1002 = Maximum memory used (bytes)                " + str( memory( HB_MEM_USEDMAX     ) )
to reduce the cost of single loop a little bit more.

The idea is to execute GC automatically but quite seldom to not reduce
the overall performance. If not necessary do not execute it at all.

Przemek

Hi Przemek,

Yes I understood your explanation and it works :). But this cycle of
100.000, is possible set this or the GC is about who determines how much
should the cycle?

best regards,

Rossine.

Hi Viktor,

I'm trying to compile using the command below and give this error:
hbmk2 -gtgui -inc -st -trace -oSYSTEM *.prg SYSTEMP.RC

It is returning me the error below:

Error BASE/1075  Argument error: >
Called from FINDNEWERHEADERS(3064)
Called from HBMK(2449)
Called from MAIN(173)

However, if I put the files one by one. PRG compiles without errors.

I am doing something wrong?
My file. BPH is as below:

libs=hwgui hbbmcdx procmisc hbmzip hbziparc hbct hbtip hbwin xhb hbhpdf
libhpdf libpng hbblat blat version
gt=gtgui

Hi Viktor,

Well I noticed that using the *. PRG CORRING it leaves my file. PRG FUNC
MAIN which is almost the end of the list, and using the hbmk2 with all file
names. PRG file my main column is on the list of files . PRG and compiles
without problems.
Now, how do I set which file is what is FUNC MAIN?

Hi Leonardo,
Try to use MAIN as the main function, or you can try using -main=MYENTRY
hbmk2 option to set it to a different name.

Thanks for the other bug report, it should be fixed now.

Brgds,
Viktor

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + Added support for envvar HB_VISUALC_VER_PRE80 to signal 
      older MSVC versions (just like in Harbour builds).
    + Synced mscvarm optimization switches.
      The sync between hbmk2 and Harbour build switches is 
      now done. The only - intentional - difference is that 
      hbmk2 won't set any explicit C compiler warning level,
      but this also can be implemented later with optional 
      switches.
    ! Fixed regression in win/icc linker name.

Now I set it arbitrary in GC code to fixed value.
In the future I may change it to some dynamically calculated value
and/or introduce some user SET to control it.

Thank you very much.
There is still unportable code which tries to detect MS-Windows version:

../../gtqtc.cpp:173: error: ?OSVERSIONINFO? was not declared in this scope
../../gtqtc.cpp:173: error: expected `;' before ?osvi?
../../gtqtc.cpp:175: error: ?osvi? was not declared in this scope
../../gtqtc.cpp:176: error: ?GetVersionEx? was not declared in this scope

The 'WindowCloseButtonHint' is probably caused by the QT version.
BTW Can we remove this line:
   #define QT_VERSION 0x040500
from hbqt.h?
Why we have it? Is it necessary for MS-Windows QT ports?

best regards,
Przemek

Probably we should leave it only as build time feature.
Please do not forget that the runtime switch is a hack which
may not work at all in some cases and I do not know any clean
and portable way to resolve it.
On some platforms tools like valgrind may not be available
so in some cases we may find FMSTAT as very important feature.
Using separate FMSTAT library is not a must. Now we have tool
like hbmk2 which works on all platforms we can simply introduce
full HVM library linked FMSTAT if we will want to keep link time
FM switch.
Also Harbour core code status in current days is different then few
years ago. The memory leaks are very seldom and rather do not appear
in core code so the FMSTAT is necessary mostly to test some new
(usually contrib) C code. For C++ code which we have for QT library
our FMSTAT is not enough to report memory leaks caused by missing
DELETE for objects allocated by NEW so we have to use external tools
to debug memory leaks.

best regards,
Przemek

It's not, the value is defined by qglobal.h, included two lines below.

Maybe You make new RDD "VFP" for Visual FoxPro CDX indexes as hacked DBFCDX

Thanks Przemek, my suggestion is then to make HB_FM_STATISTICS_DYN_OFF
the default build setting in Harbour (both release and normal builds),
this will
include stat code, but in disabled state, causing only minimal overhead
(one
compare CPU instruction per hb_x*() call). Stats can be enabled by using
envvar 'HB_FM_STAT=yes' on any systems before starting up the app.

At the same time I'll remove separate fmstat lib and also the
fmstat related
hbmk2/hbmk options.

This way we will have a simple, well hidden, but still runtime setting,
equally
usable with all tools and in all situations with virtually no overhead.

Opinions on above?

Brgds,
Viktor

(previous version), maybe older pocc and dmc. We can change

It does not have to work on all systems. On some it may even break
default build or some possible builds.
To read envvars we have to call some OS/CRTL function which may need memory
for environment and internally may call malloc()/free() which could be
overloaded by our FM stat module so it will call our own function which
will call OS/CRTL function to check HB_FM_STAT envvar, etc...
I'm trying to say that our dynamic FM module initialization is a hack which
may work but does not have to. It can work now but stop with new C compiler
or CRTL/LIBC version, f.e. LIBC ver.X may store envvars in some static area
but LIBC ver.X+1 will use dynamically allocated region.
IMHO this hack with envvar 'HB_FM_STAT=yes' is acceptable for some private
usage when user/developer exactly knows what will happen in his environment
so it can use it in some local well tested environment for his own risk but
making it default is very bad idea.

If you find portable method to set initial state of FM module which will
work in all cases then it will be good to make it.
Unfortunately I do not know such method.
BTW such method will allow to also use many different FM modules. If we find
clean way to enable/disable FMSTAT then it should also be possible to use it
to chose different memory manager.

some compilers probably cannot benefit from it.
AFAIK BCC does not support any interprocedural optimizations so we can
leave it just to test if separated compilation still work. It will force
to keep source code separated, otherwise we may end with mixed code hard
to understand, debug or modify. BCC is popular enough to have user feedback
if some modification will volatile separation.
Anyhow making HB_HVM_ALL=yes default for compilers which support IPO
(MSVC, ICC, GCC, OpenWatcom) is IMHO good idea.

Fine, I'll make it the default for all compilers except pocc*, xcc and bcc.(the
rest is exactly msvc*, gcc family, owatcom and icc family).

Isn't it a solution to use '#define USE_DL_PREFIX' for all
compilers, just like we do now for msvc*?

This way we wouldn't collide with RTL mem functions,
so it would be safe to use getenv().

The other solution is to use pure OS calls instead of getenv().
We're already doing this for win and os2, there is probably
a way do this for other platforms, surely there is for dos,
I don't know about *nixes, maybe direct access to 'environ'
or equivalent global var can help. If, however there isn't a way to
extract environment here safely, we way resort to some such
methods on these platform, which can be accessed using
system calls without the need of the CRTL.

http://svn.pdos.csail.mit.edu/svn/uia/branches/vx32-nest/clib/stdlib/getenv.c?revision=2006&view=markup&sortby=rev

BTW, do we currently have such platforms where current
getenv() method doesn't work or in any ways problematic?

Yes, that would be even cooler. Would make testing/benchmarking
very easy.

But it will be still Windows only RDD which cannot be used on any other
OSes so it will only increase the gray area of strict MS binary
compatibility. Personally I do not like to take a part in such process.
But it's a free project and if someone is interested then he can make it.
In such case I would like to ask to not add such functionality to core code
but create new RDD in contrib.

No. We do not use DLMALLOC as default for all builds.
The default memory manager in SUSE Linux is much more efficient
then DLMALLOC and very well scalable in MT mode. In such systems
using DLMALLOC is not an alternative at all.

We have to make FM statistic working with default memory manager.
On some systems DLMALLOC is too slow in comparison to the default
one and on some others we do not have DLMALLOC port at all, f.e.
OS2 builds or DOS builds.
But on OS-es where DLMALLOC works then probably we can try to use
it with USE_DL_PREFIX only for FMSTAT module and other memory manager
for default mode.

What does it mean pure OS call for you?
Where did you found information that SetEnvironmentVariable() or
DosScanEnv() is pure OS function call or that getenv() cannot be
such pure OS function call on some systems?

What do you think 'environ' variable is?
Where it points? where this memory exists and how it was allocated?
Who intialize this variable and when? Before or after our startup code?
Is it real variable on all platforms? Maybe on some platforms it's only
fixed for each process memory address set by C compiler or linker?
Maybe it's necessary to allocate some memory to copy parent process
environment and set this variable as pointer to this memory? Maybe
the memory block can be copied only by kernel so such operation needs
kernel space call but on some other systems it may be done in user
space only? Or maybe the information is passed by pseudo files and
it's necessary to allocate buffer to read from such file? Maybe
the same OS uses different method on different hardware, different
kernel switches or even different user/process privileges?

To answer it's necessary to very well know low level OS and C compiler
implementation for each port. But even if someone has such knowledge
then it's still possible that he will answer that it's not documented
that current functionality will have to exists in the future releases
because it's part of system area without public API.

And probably it will force the cleanest implementation but I still
do not think that it should be the goal itself because the final result
may block or make much harder adding some other extensions to Harbour,
f.e. using garbage collector only memory managers which introduce new
platform dependent rules for compilation and linking

Anybody know a tool free or commercial good for final user (like
microsoft access):
very easy to use
able to query & reporting without re import table
Capable of working on large database with optimisation

Integrated with  dbf & four big of database Mssql,Oracle,mysql,Postgress

Now access have a integration with dbf only via slow odbc but a lot of
user want use it
Anybody can suggest a real alternative

True. But if we don't use DLMALLOC we aren't redefining OS mem alloc
function, are we? So in such case we don't have this kind of problem in
the first place. If we use some alternate mem manager which doesn't
provide such prefixing, it can be a problem.

Okay, but I'd like to leave this change for you.

It means not defined by CRTL thus not relying on CRTL functions,
like CRTL mem allocation functions.

I didn't say getenv() cannot be a system function, but GetEnvVariable()
is defined in kernel32, so it for sure is one. DosScanEnv() I cannot
confirm
100%, but since it's in the regular OS/2 system namespace, and since
we aren't doing any compiler protection when using it, I believe it's
defined
by an OS module, not CRTL. Similarly in DOS a DOS interrupt counts as
system (AFAIR you need to get psp address and parse it manually, I did
this long ago with Clipper before switching to Clipper/MSC undoc symbols).

'environ' used to be initialized by app startup stub based on plat dep
logic. It's still not exactly clear to me when our startup functions are
executed on each platforms, but I assumed they are executed by
app startup code, *after* initializing such variables. I'm assuming this
because we're either using official methods or C++, or in case of
MSVC a segment trick which guarantees this.

I still don't see how our local hb_x*() memory functions can interfere
with any CRTL mem functions if we don't use colliding names like
malloc() and free(). Isn't it enough to avoid it? We certainly don't
use any CRTL returned allocated pointers in hb_getenv_buffer()
which later needs to be handed to our own functions, so that part
seems fine.

Probably I'm missing something, but cannot see what.

Hi Pritpal,

Could you please replace in hbqtgen.prg the line 2278:

   aadd( txt_, '   oMenuBar:show()                                                                                                        ' )

with:

   aadd( txt_, '   oWnd:setMenuBar( QT_PTROF( oMenuBar ) )                                                                                ' )

for a better menu bar functionality. This change has been tested on Vista. Thank you.

Regards,
Istv?n

Doesn't link here either, but with slightly different errors.

I'll fix the hb_oleInit() problem (which is missing #include),
but I'll leave the rest for someone else, oaidl.h is included
via oleauto.h which is included via ole2.h which is included
by hbwinole.h. uuid lib is included so that can't be a problem.

Only a note
ads v 9 use  visual fox pro 9 data and index and run in win 32-64- and Linux

 ADS<9 has provided support for FoxPro tables and CDX/IDX indexes for
a long time, ADS 9 has added full support for Visual FoxPro tables,
including auto-increment, date/time, and VarChar fields. Advantage can
use its proprietary, high-performance locking with Visual FoxPro
tables, but also supports a compatibility mode, permitting legacy
applications that access the Visual FoxPro tables directly to co-exist
with newer, Advantage-based applications. Advantage adds the new
ADS_VFP table type for this support.


so is samebody want share data with a visual foxpro9 application can
use rddads in local mode (free)
Advantage is also available in a local file server version, similar to
isam. This version, the Advantage Local Server, is free.

here you can download aceapi
http://www.sybase.com/products/databasemanagement/advantagedatabaseserver
recompile rddads point to this lib

#include "ads.ch"
request ADS
procedure main
 RddSetdefault( "ADS" )
 AdsSetFileType( ADS_CDX )
 RddRegister ( "ADS", 1 )
 AdsSetServerType( ADS_LOCAL_SERVER )

IMO, leave and show all warnings from default, but how advertise
new msvc compiler user to don?t worry about this? To avoid polute
harbour list with such things as I did!

Hi,

The main problem with the existing solution is that the MenuBar object:

   oMenuBar := QMenuBar():new( QT_PTROF( oWnd ) )

defined in demoqt isn't connected to the QMainWindow object. This fact can be easily checked by the QMainWindow resizing; the MenuBar doesn't follows this operation.
The proposed solution connects the MenuBar object to the QMainWindow object, correcting the QMainWindow behavior.

Regards,
Istv?n

Can you explain a bit what artifacts it corrects?

Hi Massimo,
You got stuck in an infinite loop, and just increasing the noise
I'm afraid.

I've explicitly covered this specific problem in my mail on Apr 1
(but it wasn't a joke), with a three lines which does actually work,
but, you apparently *still* didn't read it.

Sorry to say, but this really raises the question if it's worth
answering at all.

Brgds,
Viktor

I agree, it's a msvc bug

Hi Ranier,

Ppl seldom worry about warnings, especially when there are that many of them
:) If anyone does, I think it's just a good
thing and it encourages correcting them eventually. Maybe
someone can even go and send us such patches.

Brgds,
Viktor

It clears few of my assumptions.
Keep me informed about such facts.

pexports ace32.dll > ace32.def

Now the remain the problem thath not able to  manage to use libace32.a
 to actually link a Harbour executable.
 Same missing symbols demostraded by

Wich question can post in sybase ads newsgroup regarding this problem?

Can help follow information?

Hi Pritpal,
Many thanks, just a few observations after testing with demoqtc.prg:
- Makefile needs to be updated according to hbqt Makefile in order to
  make it work on Darwin. hbqt Makefile can be used as-is, it's enough
  to replace file list.
- demoqtc.prg should be replaced by our tests/wvtext.prg test program,
  as it should work similarly with both GTs, that would help testing and
  spotting differences.
- I'm not sure codepages are handled correctly, ALERT() box drawing
  chars are wrong here (showing as accented chars).
- Great deal of flicker and the app even *loses focus* for a moment when
  using resize button, changing closable setting, maybe more.
- Resize doesn't work.
- Mark & Copy doesn't work.

If I try to link my app with hbzlib, I'm getting this:

If I omit hbzlib, I'm getting this:

So it looks like QT isn't compatible with our local hbzlib instance.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello Viktor

Thanks for compiling and reviewing GTQTC.

- Makefile needs to be updated according to hbqt Makefile in order to
  make it work on Darwin. hbqt Makefile can be used as-is, it's enough
  to replace file list.

OK. I do in a minute.

- demoqtc.prg should be replaced by our tests/wvtext.prg test program,
  as it should work similarly with both GTs, that would help testing and
  spotting differences.

Yes, I was just testing caret interface, will do shortly.

- I'm not sure codepages are handled correctly, ALERT() box drawing
  chars are wrong here (showing as accented chars).

I tried but am failing how to implement it. Przemek's assisstance required
here.

- Great deal of flicker and the app even *loses focus* for a moment when
  using resize button, changing closable setting, maybe more.

This is the only way I could handle this artifact, so far, may be someone 
comeup with a better idea.

- Resize doesn't work.

Still on pending list. I have an idea how to achieve.

- Mark & Copy doesn't work.

I am absolutely at a loss how can I access the SysMenu in QT.
There is no reference to this fact in whole QT documentation.

May be QT implemets its own zip functions which are colliding with
Harbour's.
No idea how to cover it.

It's a small bug in -nohbp handling which I'll fix ASAP, but -dyn doesn't
exist
please try with -hbdyn.

I'm afraid I don't know... I've added this feature in the hope
that those who need/understand/use it will help fixing the
remaining details. I've never seen such .dll work in the life
of Harbour, at least on my machine.

You can use -trace or -traceonly to get the exact commands
and tweak them until it works. Probably hbmaindllp lib is needed
somewhere in the process.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes, thanks you
hbmk.bat -hbdyn -lhbmaindllp.lib something.prg

Possibly hbmk2 must add hbmaindllp.lib automatically for  the use from
-hbdyn?

I'm developing an application right now, but, since the application
must be accessible to the general public via the web
so using same tecnique of Google Web Toolkit (translate Java sources

Hi,

The Makefile doesn't generate the gtqtc lib. Maybe the library name is wrong, could you please review?
Thanks.

Why not create contrib library using  hbmk2?
More simple to recompile and maintain
a user will recompile a single contrib without require gnu make

Great job Pritpal,

Just one observation. Could you please modify the MenuBar object build of harbour/contrib/hbqt/tests/wvtext.prg in the same way as for demoqt.prg:

    ! oMenuBar:show() => oWnd:setMenuBar( QT_PTROF( oMenuBar ) )

I can't test it, just checked the sources.

Regards,
Istv?n

Why not create contrib library using  hbmk2?
More simple to recompile and maintain
a user will recompile a single contrib without require gnu make

Yes, it's an option, but first we need to wait a bit until hbmk2 is
mature/tested
enough on all platforms, also for lib generation.
After this, and that we've made it the default make tool in
Harbour, we can reconsider using it instead of using GNU Make
for contribs. This would certainly give a lot of flexibility since all
these contribs would then be fully untied from our SVN bits, so
they could easily be moved on and off our tree.

First I'll switch to hbmk2 for my local projects and test it on all
platforms.

Brgds,
Viktor

Please, try it simple demo
========= 
something.prg 
========= 
FUNCTION Hello() 
RETURN "Hello From Dll!!" 
========= 

========= 
test.prg 
========= 
DYNAMIC Hello

PROCEDURE main()
LOCAL dll, sym
	//
	dll := hb_libLoad("something.dll")
	IF !Empty( dll ) 
		? hb_libDo( "HELLO" )
	ENDIF

	sym := &("@Hello()")
	? sym:exec()
=========

hbmk2 -hbdyn -lhbmaindllp.lib something.prg
hbmk2 -shared test.prg

It work as expected but ONLY if  test.prg compiled with -shared. 
So I think while early to changes in  hbmk2.

Regards,
Petr

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit
Creating an artist and album management form
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xformsgwt2/
Note that artist and album Seem me a typically clipper application
Smart chat application called "Leeloo Chat", fully made from scratch

I believe the uhttp.prg is more than a first step ... you not? Already
studied how to integrate GWT with it?

I think i found an error in hbmk2 for linux

Hi Guy,
hbmk2 isn't doing any transformation regarding lib prefix,
so the solution here is not to pass it via ginfo.hbp.

into hbmk2 in order to go this way.

$ cat ginfo.hbp

I fix ginfo.hbp :
$ cat ginfo.hbp
libs=hbmysql mysqlclient

and now t2 (and ginfo) compile fine.

I did not think that, by default, all .hbp files in the current 
directory were processed.

Unidirectional Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or UHTTP. UHTTP is a
simple, robust, one-way data transfer protocol that is designed to
efficiently deliver resource data in a one-way broadcast-only
environment. This transfer protocol is appropriate for delivery of
HTML and other content resources using IP multicast over television
vertical blanking interval (IP/VBI) and other unidirectional transport
systems.
uhttp will be a Method and apparatus for remote update of clients by a
server via broadcast satellite IMO are the founders idea for
GTNET/RDDNET

Where can found uhttp.prg?

Hi All,
Issuing this command:
C:\hb\harbour-11\bin\harbour.exe -n1 todbc.prg browodbc.prg
-iC:/hb/harbour-11/include /usr/include /usr/local/pgsql/include
/usr/local/pgsql/include/libpq /usr/include/pgsql

[ the command makes no sense, it's just an accidental cmdline I happen to
have stumbled upon while hbmk2 development ]

will result in this:
Unrecoverable error 9011: hb_xfree called with a NULL pointer

Brgds,
Viktor

    + Added experimental support for header directory autodetection.
      This means that you can pass a list of possible dirs to use
      when a .c header cannot be found in explicitly passed locations.
    ! Fixed to always disable -shared with -hbdyn.
    ! Added hbmaindllp in -hbdyn mode on win|wce.
    ! Fix in -nohbp parameter handling.
    + Added support for macros in -L, -*flag=, -workdir=
    + Added -stop command line parameter which stops execution.
      Can be used in conjunction with arch/comp filters to stop
      execution on certain platforms/compilers.
    ! Fixed to not create workdir in some unlikely combination of options.
    ! Fixed typo causing newer headers not being detected in resource files.
    + Now 'unix' can also be used in filters to check for any *nix platform.
    % Excluding some well-known headers from parsing (windows.h, ole2, os2.h
      currently)
    ; Above changes makes it possible to use hbmk2 to build our contribs.
      The only missing feature is 'install', what is a simple copy.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    + .c header detection now takes place before doing anything.
      Also compiler setup got moved to the beginning of the
      process.
      This allows to make a stop if something is missing. Some
      more steps are needed to exploit that in practice.
      Please test, this may cause regressions, I didn't test
      all combinations.
    * Generalized internal support for header location detection.
      (now can support any C compiler and it's also possible to
      add this feature for .prg files if needed)
    + Added new filter keywords: allgcc, allwin, allmingw, allmsvc,
      allpocc, allicc.
    + Added support for include dirs with spaces for msvc and mingw.

Message-ID: <18d502870904200608if839014m6ce75508e3a792eb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I'm testing hbmk2 with real life, large project, hundreds of input files.

I've run into a problem where the final link phase (using gcc) returns
with error 1 (using mingw), but there is no actual mingw error (iow
the command line is correct).

If I copy out the full command line, it's about 13500 chars long and
when executed from a .bat file, I'm getting 'The input line is too long.'.
It cannot handle more than about 8192 chars.

Now, what is interesting is that I *am* able to build this project using
GNU Make, with an even slightly longer command line (~14600 chars).

What method may GNU Make be using that it works? What is the way
to push large command lines through hb_run() on Windows. My guess
(which is confirmed by peeking into system() RTL source code, is that
it uses the shell to execute the command, which has the same limitation
as .bat files obviously).

Can we replace system() with something else? Or can I replace hb_run()
with some other, existing method?

And my final question is: what is the way to use a response file with
gcc (mingw/cygwin)? [ my former research was fruitless. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

Thanks Pritpal this and previous commits, I'll check them a bit later.
It'd be nice to get a way to link gtqtc/hbqt together with hbmzip (and
hbzlib),
otherwise I cannot do any real life testing. This would also seriously
limit usability of our QT support. If anyone has any idea how to solve it,
please speak up.

Brgds,
Viktor

On alaska ng Andi Jahja have informed me:

Hi,

For use with MinGW, you do not have to create anything, but you can
rename the distributed ace32.lib (for MSVC) as libace32a. as follows:

  COPY ace32.lib libace32.a

And use the file as usual.

Andi

What and how can I reproduce the incompatibility?

Viktor -help works fine now, tks!

I did some testing with fwh.hbp that came with the hbmk2 and I was to
change some parameters to compile and link successfully. I am sending
you attached, I hope you can help others who use the FW to compile
easily with hbmk2:

#
# $Id: fwh.hbp
#
gui=yes
{win}libs=fiveh fivehc
{win}libs=hbwin.lib cw32.lib uuid.lib odbc32.lib nddeapi.lib
iphlpapi.lib msimg32.lib rasapi32.lib

this file above works fine. However I tried to use the macros to
reduce the command line typed and not succeed, if you can give me a
suggestion where I am missing I thanks:

Hi Vailton,

Few suggestions/comments:
- Don't use .lib extension as it will be added automatically anyway, and it
just makes you script compiler specific.
- You don't need to add cw32.lib, which is bcc specific and is automatically
added by hbmk2.
- You also don't need some system libs, since these are added by hbmk2
automatically also: odbc32, msimg32, uuid.
- I'd suggest to properly configure bcc32.cfg instead of passing PSDK dir
through libpath. This way it should also work, but needs an additional
envvar to be setup maintained (BCDIR). BTW, there is a typo in the
paranthesis, which makes it not work in your example.
- gt=gtgui is a better choice than -gui for Windows GUI programs not needing
a terminal GT.
  It also automatically selects -gui mode.
- '-inctrypath' is currently for .c headers only, so for .prg you'll need:
  {win}prgflags=-i${FWDIR}\include
- If you know the exact path of your .c headers, I'd recommend this, rather
than '-inctrypath':
  {win}cflags=-I${FWDIR}\include

[ maybe I'll later add an '-incpaths' option which will do this
in one step in fully compiler independent form. ]

--- fwh.hbp #1
{win}prgflags=-i${FWDIR}\include
{win}cflags=-I${FWDIR}\include
{win}libpaths=${FWDIR}\lib

{win}gt=gtgui

{win}libpaths=${BCDIR}\lib\PSDK
{win}libs=fiveh fivehc
{win}libs=hbwin nddeapi iphlpapi rasapi32
---

Here's a second one cleaned from envvars, this one needs to be
copied to FWDIR and added to the command line with full path:
hbmk2 C:\fwh\fwh.hbp <myprog.prg>

--- fwh.hbp #2
{win}prgflags=-i${hb_self}include
{win}cflags=-I${hb_self}include
{win}libpaths=${hb_self}lib

{win}gt=gtgui

{win}libs=fiveh fivehc
{win}libs=hbwin nddeapi iphlpapi rasapi32
---

[ Note, I didn't try any of these locally. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

It's possible to silence such warnings, but I wouldn't recommend doing it.It's
better to resolve them.

Please remove hbdebug lib from the liblist and upgrade to the latest SVN
version of hbmk2 to resolve warnings for GETSYS.

Brgds,
Viktor

I don't know either since I never use the same public function name in
different modules, sorry. My opinion's that such practice
is wrong, but at least compiler/linker implementation dependent,
thus non-portable and dangerous. Anyway it's not a hbmk2 issue,
so I cannot fix it there. If you want you can suppress it by
passing appropriate linker commands via -ldflag= hbmk2 option.

Brgds,
Viktor

Possibly after this change, I'm getting this:

Shocking. IBM sounded better than ORA from an OSS POV.
We should concentrate on PostgreSQL I guess.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.prg
    ! Fixed to find headers in originating file directory.
      This may need further tweaking. This works a little
      differently in Harbour and C compilers and hbmk2 tries
      to mimic both. Possible that it's still not fully
      compatible, if you know something pls speak up.
    + Added -incpath= option and incpaths= .hbp option. This
      is now the preferred method to add headers paths. All
      path will be added to both Harbour and C compiler.
      Important: a synonym for this switch is simply -i, just
      like before, but now the path will be also added to
      C compiler command line.
    * From now on Harbour include dir will always be the first
      one on the include path list passed to compilers. Before
      in Harbour it was always first, in C compilers it was
      always last. (disregarding include dirs passed directly
      to compiler, which will always come first, but isn't
      recommended). The ordering is thus this:
      compiler ... flags harbourincludedir incpaths ...
    - Deleted include path option detection, from now on
      only those paths will be scanned wich were passed to
      hbmk2 via -incpath/-i options.
    % Added -kmo optimization for hbmk2 source.
    + -info and -quiet will now work in .hbm files.
      (they will not control some close-to-startup messages
      if specified this way though)

  * external/libhpdf/Makefile
  * external/libpng/Makefile
    + Enabled for darwin.

  * contrib/hbqt/generator/hbqtgen.prg
    ! Recent fix to hbqt.h applied to generator.

  * utils/hbmk2/hbmk2.hbm
    - Removed no longer needed -km switch.

  * utils/hbmk2/examples/hmg.hbp
  * utils/hbmk2/examples/hwgui.hbp
  * utils/hbmk2/examples/fwh.hbp
    % Updated to use -incpaths=

  * utils/hbmk2/examples/fwh.hbp
    * Updated to work like similar hwgui and hmg files.
    ; QUESTION: Is hbwin lib required for FWH?

Yes, I got the file buildh.bat that has the latest version of FWH and
I wrote a .HBP based on it. Below is a copy attached for you to see

Thanks for clarification,i highly appreciate your suggestionNever use same
public function name in different modules because is wrong and dangerous
Now i try rewrite each situation to better manage this
I think remove duplication function using #if def
If other user have made similar situation i invite share his experience will
be useful for everybody
I think fault because In personalised getlist,errorlist use same public
function mane

Thanks for the info. Current hbmk2 + fwh.hbp in SVN is correct then.
I'd be interested in your test results with them.

As I wrote, you *can* override Harbour RTL *modules* (like getsys and
errorsys).
In your case probably your local getsys version doesn't define all public
functions
which are defined in RTL version. When done right, it's possible to
override either
by putting local version in custom lib or directly in source.

Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] OT - Programming Concepts Input
Message-ID: <23149809.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello All

I am asigned a project to develop an application 
to manage documents ( company wide ) to 
provide a paperless environment. Application 
needs to be responsible for scanning, storing and 
locating the scanned documents on demand.

The <LOCATing> part seems to be tricky and demands 
a careful planning how the images will be recognized
based on different search criteria. 

May be someone of you has/had undergone a project
like this, and may be willing to share his experiences, 
will be highly appreciated.

I plan to execute this project on following lines:

1) Develop hbxbp.lib, Xbase++ compatible parts to base its GUI.
2) To base hbxbp.lib on QT.
3) In the process design and implement storage and locating strategy.
4) Implement QT's powerful Widgets on PRG level which could not 
    be done through Xbase++ parts.

This effectively endorses three-way development, QT, Xbase++Parts,
and the project.

Any thoughts, suggessions, code, anything is welcome.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

I do not create index - it's not problem.
If I in ADS make index - all work OK.
I must open existing index (only for read) maked by aplication of VFP.
Standard Harbour DBFCDX can't open this CDX.
ADS open this CDX and work OK except order on field type INTEGER
( STR(field_integer) work OK )

Another problem with ADS is not work with "CODEPAGE" extension

 REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_PLWIN
 HB_SETCODEPAGE("PL852")  //program and dispaly codepage
 USE base NEW CODEPAGE "PLWIN"  //auto translate PLWIN -> PL852

Hi all,

I am testing Harbour with Ubuntu Server 9.04 rc.

To compile Harbour sources, i have to install the package xorg-dev, 
because the library gtxwc do not compile without this package.

But Ubuntu Server don't need a X-Server. Question: How to ignore gtxwc 
when compiling Harbour in a Linux installation (console mode only) ?

I do not think so. This index is not binary compatible with CDX format.
It can be open by ADS and also by Harbour if we remove some index type
validation which now generates RT error.

Intentionally. It's not CDX format. Yet another undocumented MS extensions.
Fortunately here it can be easy implemented on all platforms so I can add
support for this extensions to core code.

> ( STR(field_integer) work OK )

And this index uses internally non CDX format. Harbour nicely
detects it and generate RT error. ADS open it because it does
not validate key size but it does not know anything about this
format so index does not work correctly. IMHO Harbour behavior
is correct.
It's also an answer about using CDX indexes with some VFP/MS-Win
only extension in ADS. Looks that it does not work what is
rather expected behavior.
In exactly this case MS hacked format of numbers stored in index
file and it's very easy to guess what they exactly did so I can
add support for such indexes to Harbour to all builds without
any problem because I do not have to touch windows API.
I'll commit it but it will not help you in any way in character
indexes which can be open but they still will not work correctly.
Add to your test code this few lines to see what happens with
character keys in VFP indexes.

   ordSetFocus(2)
   dbgotop()
   while !eof()
      ? &(ordKey()), ordKeyVal()
      dbskip()
   enddo
   inkey(0)

For read only mode you can use such indexes with "EN" codepage
because the keys are already in binary format which should be
sorted without any national characters.

> Another problem with ADS is not work with "CODEPAGE" extension

Any indexes with this undocumented VFP extensions will not play well
with different codepages. They are hardcoded to Windows API, Windows
codepages and MS national collating hash function which is not public
and not compatible with Unicode universal collating algorithm.
I do no think that ADS will fully support such indexes but I could be
wrong. Just ask Extended System about it and what they use for non
Windows ADS ports. It can be very interesting information.

My personal advice:
Drop any tools which are not binary compatible with documented standard.
If MS is not able to keep the standards then it's time to migrate from
MS environment to some more professional solutions.

For some reasons we lost auto detection from make_gnu.sh build scripts
though maybe it was only in removed ./make_gcc.sh. I do not remember.
Anyhow it should work for RPM and DEB packages.
If you are using DEB based distribution then you should use ./mpkg_deb.sh
to create DEB packages with Harbour binaries. It also automatically
detects if libx11-dev is installed and sets
    export HB_WITHOUT_X11=yes
if necessary. You can also set this envvar manually to yes/no values
to force requested behavior.
BTW as I can see the lib name used by you was xorg-dev not libx11-dev.
If xorg-dev does not provide libx11-dev aliassing then this lines in
mpkg_deb.sh:

   if [ -z "$HB_WITHOUT_X11" ] && ! test_reqpkg libx11-dev
   then
       export HB_WITHOUT_X11=yes
   fi

should be changed to:

   if [ -z "$HB_WITHOUT_X11" ] && \
      ! test_reqpkg libx11-dev && ! test_reqpkg xorg-dev
   then
       export HB_WITHOUT_X11=yes
   fi

otherwise GTXWC will not be created at all if you do not force it by
   export HB_WITHOUT_X11=no

Can you check it?

Przemek,

The package xorg-dev is installed (is a meta-package and libx11-dev is 
included). After a svn update, i executed the script mpkg_deb.sh 
(whithout changes) and the script worked ok. Note: i don?t defined the 
variable HB_WITHOUT_X11.

After a "sudo dpkg -i harbour-1.0.1-1_i386.deb", i have harbour 
installed and working (tested with a small prg and hbmk2).

In folder /usr/lib/harbour, i can see:

libgtcgi.a
libgtpca.a
libgtstd.a
libgttrm.a
libgtxwc.a

Tell me if you need more tests.

Hi Vailton,

This is caused by incomplete bcc32.cfg/ilink32.cfg, also see my
prev mail. It's not hbmk2 or Harbour hbp job to fix incomplete bcc
installations, so it should be corrected locally. Unfortunate Borland
forgot to highlight this configuration detail in their README.
Anyway you can also add the PSDK lib manually on the command
line or additional local .hbp file, but I'd prefer to leave it for now
from our files since they'd be highly bcc specific hacks on the
wrong place. Besides, we would have to know the location of PSDK
dir on users computer, which cannot be done without further ugly
hacks and knowledge of version specific / non-documented bcc
internals.

I've found that bcc codepath didn't add hbmk2 win sys liblist
to the linker command. I'll correct that ASAP.

At the same time this will mean that hbmk2 will be broken
for everyone with not properly configured bcc.

In some other cases, the FW provides native support for ODBC and

ODBC32.LIB is missing inside fwh.hbp... See it in buildh.bat which is

I'll add odbc32 lib to the std list of system headers. If anyone is
aware of any problems this may cause, pls tell. Alternatively we
can add it to fwh.hbp.

Brgds,
Viktor

Sorry I don't understand. You simply have to use unique public names
in your app, both in .prg and .c, that's all.

You must redefine the whole module (file = object). Linking is done
per object file, not per function.

This makes no sense, please read that output again, the collision is
elsewhere.

Now i have understandI miss because my object/file is named getsys_d.prg
instead getsys.prg
I must redefine the whole module (file = object). Linking is done per object
file, not per function.
will be redefined function contained in same module name or better module
with same name will be substituted
replaceable function not exist in harbour like in clipper where afaik is at
function level
now i have understand because there is a lot of module in
c:\harbour\source\rtl so is possible alert,inkey,achoice replacement (each
for file/module)

Message-ID: <23163007.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

It appears multi-threading support in QT 
is sadly limited and does not go with all-the-powerful 
offering in Harbour.

These are my first experiments and so I may be wrong.

I am trying to execute wvtext.prg with -mt option and 
executing F10<New Window> which should be executed 
in a separate thread. I can see new window opened but 
then the inkey() loop, and also applctn loop, gets 
cofused.

Yet I do not know what is causing such abnormality, 
QT or gtqtc.c architect. QT documentation suggests that 
appln always run in a single event loop.

If someone has any clues to this paradigm then please 
speakup, otherwise, to me it seems to be show stopper.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

I don?t tested gtqtc yet, but Qt have the class QEventLoop:

"Detailed Description
The QEventLoop class provides a means of entering and leaving an event loop.

At any time, you can create a QEventLoop object and call exec() on it to 
start a local event loop. From within the event loop, calling exit() 
will force exec() to return."

Can each Window in gtqtc have your own event loop ?

    Local oButton

    oApplication := QApplication():New()

    oWindow := QWidget():New()
    oWindow:Resize(320, 240)

    oButton:SetText("OK")
    oButton:Resize(80, 30)
    oButton:Move((320-80)/2, (240-30)/2)
    oButton:Show()
    oButton:Connect("clicked()", {|p|NewWindow()})

    oApplication:exec()

Return

Function NewWindow ()

    Local oWindow
    Local oEventLoop
    Local oButton
    Static n := 0

    ++n

    oWindow := QWidget():New()
    oWindow:Resize(320, 240)
    oWindow:SetWindowTitle("Window "+str(n,2))
    oWindow:Show()

    oEventLoop := QEventLoop():New(oWindow)

    oButton := QPushButton():New(oWindow)
    oButton:SetText("OK")
    oButton:Resize(80, 30)
    oButton:Move((320-80)/2, (240-30)/2)
    oButton:Show()
    oButton:Connect("clicked()", 
{|p|qt_qwidget_close(oWindow:pointer),MsgInfo("Closing window 
"+qt_qwidget_windowtitle(oWindow:pointer)),oEventLoop:exit(0)})

    oEventLoop:exec(0)

Return nil


Using QEventLoop, i can have 'n' windows, each window with your own 
event loop.

Marcos

Thanks for the explanation.
I know about this facts but note that 
this operates on different widgets in the main 
thread. I am talking about different threads.

Try this :

#include "qt.ch"

Procedure Main ()

    Local oApplication
    Local oWindow
    Local oButton

    oApplication := QApplication():New()

    oWindow := QWidget():New()
    oWindow:Resize(320, 240)
    oWindow:SetWindowTitle("Testing class QEventLoop")
    oWindow:Show()

    oButton := QPushButton():New(oWindow)
    oButton:SetText("OK")
    oButton:Resize(80, 30)
    oButton:Move((320-80)/2, (240-30)/2)
    oButton:Show()
    oButton:Connect("clicked()", hb_threadStart( {|p|NewWindow()} ) )

    oApplication:exec()

Return

Function NewWindow ()

    Local oWindow
    Local oEventLoop
    Local oButton
    Static n := 0

    ++n

    oWindow := QWidget():New()
    oWindow:Resize(320, 240)
    oWindow:SetWindowTitle("Window "+str(n,2))
    oWindow:Show()

    oEventLoop := QEventLoop():New(oWindow)

    oButton := QPushButton():New(oWindow)
    oButton:SetText("OK")
    oButton:Resize(80, 30)
    oButton:Move((320-80)/2, (240-30)/2)
    oButton:Show()
    oButton:Connect("clicked()", 
{|p|qt_qwidget_close(oWindow:pointer),MsgInfo("Closing window 
"+qt_qwidget_windowtitle(oWindow:pointer)),oEventLoop:exit(0)})

    oEventLoop:exec(0)

Return nil

Remember to compile appln with -mt switch.

With this line, don?t work:

oButton:Connect("clicked()", hb_threadStart( {|p|NewWindow()} ) )
(the parameter is not a codeblock | may be a typo)

But work with this:

oButton:Connect("clicked()", {|p|hb_threadStart({||NewWindow()})} )

I am planning more tests. I believe we can find a solution.

I put codeblock inside the function, pity on me. 
Your code is right.

If it worked then for sure we can find a solution.
Make one more test. Call the ThreadID() in both windows
and see what these return, just in case...

Tested with these changes:

...
? threadid()
oApplication:exec()
...

...
? threadid()
oEventLoop:exec(0)
...

First window (main) return 1.

Each new window return a sequential number: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...

Means I have to investigate further what else GTQTC needs 
to simulate this behavior. Can you review gtqtc.c and 
look into hbqt_init() calls, I mean where GT is being initialized?

Your tip has solved this issue.

Now GTQTC is MT compatible.
Will be posting changes in a little while.

Hello Harbour family,
Be prepared to match your applications with any other in the world.

Message-ID: <18d502870904212346s53eaccb4t2a9ad4578c132072@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Przemek,
I'm implementing .po -> .hbl generation in hbmk2 and noticed
two issues:

1) __I18N_potArrayToHash() will RTE if the first param isn't an array.
This can happen in hbi18n if __I18N_potArrayLoad() in LoadFiles()
fails for some reason (.po open error or parsing problems).
Similar RTE happens in LoadFiles() if one of the additional .po
files has any errors. (as a minor thing, open error is shown to
happen at the preceding file's last line)

2) When specifying multiple input .po files, the generation
process is very slow even if the additional .po input file is small.

Brgds,
Viktor

  + Implemented .po to .hbl conversion inside hbmk2, with
    incremental feature (.hbl will only be regenerated if any
    .po file dependencies are newer). This is currently the
    default, no -inc switch is needed for that.
    You can specify .po files in the command line, in po=
    lines in .hbp files, output file is passed via -hbl= option.
    To handle multiple languages without hassle, you can use
    ${lng} macro in .po and .hbl filenames, plus pass the list
    of languages in -lng=<lang comma list> option:
    app_${lng}.po -hbl=lang/${lng}.hbl -lng=en,hu,sk,pl
    [ Actual .po -> .hbl conversion code was taken from hbi18n
    tool made by Przemek, with little modifications. ]
  ! Fixed to check included .res file timestamp, but not parse it.
  + Added macro support in libs= .hbp lines.

Message-ID: <18d502870904220236y572630f2nc20b63f037113d06@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Pritpal and All,
I managed to solve the QT / hbmzip incompatibility by moving
QT libs in front of hbmzip.

Now my large app runs with GTQTC.

These are the first issues I could spot:

1) SetMode() doesn't seem to work properly and 2) there are quiet a
few visual glitches (even besides codepage problems). This app
uses CTWIN for windowing, no local tricks are used to display
stuff. Also, 3) after turning on the cursor, it won't appear immediately,
there is a slight delay which makes it practically invisible when
stepping through several GET fields.

Here are two screenshots WVT vs QTC:

It cannot happen. ErrorMsg() does not return.

Here also no RTE for the same reason as above.

I guess that you have RTE in modified version you used in hbmk2 where
you probably removed ErrorMsg() function call not in hb18n program.

The difference is only in __I18N_POTARRAYJOIN(). It's .prg function
so it's not very fast. The additional overhead can be caused by
merging files with exactly the same messages so it's necessary
to make deeper analyzing and merge translations, plural forms,
source file and line information, etc.
Anyhow it still should not be slow process. At least I cannot observe
anything what is worth to talk about it on my computer when I'm using
hb18n. If it's a problem then please send to me your .pot files so
I can make some tests to check what is the slowest part of merge
process and should be improved.

best regards,
Przemek

Right. I swapped them for simple OutStd() messages. That explains.

Yes, you're right. On SVN already.

I received them. Thanks.
Try to merge them after:
   2009-04-22 15:17 UTC+0200 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)

It may slow down a little bit merging small files but should be much
faster for large files due to eliminated ASCAN(). Instead hash array
is used as index to translation table.

Now the overhead of multifile input is marginal, thanks a lot for the quick

Hi

Will be good environment to test GTQTC instead of a demo appln.

Most of these glitches are due to codepage and monospaced fonts.
I am trying to cover these but soo far with little success.

There is no native function/class to manage caret so I am mimmicking 
the behavior by drawing and redraring operations via timers, a very
inefficient method, but do not know what else I should do.
Any tips are welcome to experiment along.

Yes, it does.

Yes, it also seems in some cases there is nothing painted and/or
color not changed. Anyhow I think non-existing fonts should somehow
be handled gracefully, since these may appear even if the CP is
correct, especially in Unicode mode.

I hope the CP issue can be solved in the future, it's a very important bit.

Any cursor setting should trigger an instant response instead of
just waiting for the timer to kick in. (I'm saying that without looking
at the code, but from the symptoms it looks as if something like
this causes it).

Viktor

Marcos

Can you do some deep testings with QT and hb_threadStart()? 

I mean run some real-time widgets under MT.

I have landed into more troubles than solutions with MT
in GTQTC. I want to see if Harbour MT modal is meaningful
in QT GUI context or not ? It willbecome the basis for 
next development stratedy whether we should go for 
single thread or MT way.

Pritpal Bedi

Yes, i can do. I will try windows in MT mode with controls like 
QLineEdit, QCheckBox, QRadioBox and others.

Tell me if you want some especific test.

Thanks. Please do whatever you can summerise in MT mode.
I am particularly interested in event management. 

>Tell me if you want some especific test.

Try to open new MainWindows()s. The facts will be more 
clear whether it is possible or not.

Message-ID: <23190859.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi!
Thera are BASE.DBF and BASE.NTX with key  "FunctionX(Field1)"  or key:
Field1+VariableX

Make same program with line:
  USE base INDEX base

In Clipper it is  OK, I open base with index.
In Harbour I get error "Undefined function FUNCTIONX" or "Variable does not
exist: VARIABLEX"
WHY ?
I need FunctionX() or VariableX _only_ if I modify or append record.
Maybe I wont only skip by order or seek in base.
If key is sample "Func1(Field1)+Func2(Field2)+VariableX", 
I can seek by: DBSEEK( MyFuncEmulateKeyValue() ), I not need Func1(),
Func2() and VariableX

Because during open Clipper does not check if index expressions are valid.
The RTE will appear later when it will have to evaluate some expressions.

Because Harbour checks if all index expressions (KEY/FOR) are valid when
index is open. It helps to detect problem immediately. IMHO it's much
better then later pseudo random RTE like in Clipper.

Not true. It's necessary to navigate the index. Though in some cases
depending on SHARED/EXCLUSIVE mode and used caches it may be not necessary
for some time.
I guess you created general theory from some situation which happened with
your code but it's not true.

Try this code with Clipper:

   /*** t01 ***/
   proc main()
      field F
      dbcreate("_tst",{{"F","C",1,0}})
      use _tst
      dbappend(); dbappend(); dbappend()
      index on MYFUNC(F) to _tst
      close
   return
   func myfunc( f )
   return f

to create table and index and this code:

   /*** t02 ***/
   proc main()
      use _tst index _tst
      dbgoto(2)
      while !eof()
         ? recno()
         dbskip()
      enddo
   return

Please note that when you replace
      dbgoto(2)
with:
      dbgoto(1)
it will work without RTE but only in EXCLUSIVE mode. It happens because
record 1 is still active and in exclusive mode is not discarded bu GOTO
operation. In SHARED mode it will always generate RTE.

Thanks. Now the window is resized, but not yet centered.

Cursor blinking rate _was_ fine, now it's too quick,
unfortunately the effect I've seen is unchanged. Maybe
you misunderstood me, what I wanted to say is that
GTQTC should reset the cursor to the *visible* caret
state *instantly* when the shape is changed. This way it
always becomes visible after enabling it, and you don't
have to wait for the timer to kick in, regardless of its
blinking rate.

BTW, is it possible to add system icon support?

Brgds,
Viktor

One/two more idea here:
{win}libpaths=${HB_LIB_QT}
or
{win}libpaths=${HB_DIR_QT}\lib

and you set HB_LIB_QT to your QT lib path, or HB_DIR_QT
to your QT path (exact same as for Harbour builds).

O3D is an open-source web API for creating rich, interactive 3D
applications in the browser. This API is shared at an early stage..

This White Paper informs about a QT control (based on WebKit)
which enables apps to include an embedded browser. Useful, but
 different from the idea of running as web application  (WUI).

The problem is that QT only allows the paiting operation
in QWidget.paintEvent() slot and application has no interface to 
manage it. Appln can only post a request to .update() or .repaint()
and underlying window manager is responsible to forward the 
event to the slot. I trie my level best to be as quick as possible,
but...

hb_gtInfo( HB_GTI_ICONFILE, 'test.ico' ) -> working !
OR 
What?
At  present only HB_GTI_ICONFILE is supported.

Box character support is not available yet, so strange characters...

Yes I know but don't why what factor causes it.
Try:  Press F10 -> New Window
        Click on Main Window
        Click Back on New Window
        Click on X button on New Window
        Click on X button on Main Window

I am trying hard to find out why an event is not
delivered to the message loop under certain circumstances.

Thanks for the options. I will try to find something
valuable out of it.

Subject: [Harbour] hb_ProcessIsRunning() request (to Przemek)
Message-ID: <49F0E889.1080805@fsgiudice.com>

Hi Przemek,

is it possible to add below function ?

hb_ProcessIsRunning( hProc, nTimeoutMsecs ) -> lIsRunning

to check if a process started with hb_ProcessOpen() is currently running 
so I can have:

PROC Main()
   LOCAL hOut
   LOCAL hProc := hb_ProcessOpen( "test.exe",, @hOut, @hOut, .T. )
   LOCAL nStart := hb_milliseconds()
   LOCAL cDate, cOutPut, nLen

   IF hProc > -1

      DO WHILE .T.

         cData := Space( 1000 )
         cOutPut := ""
         DO WHILE ( nLen := Fread( hOut, @cData, Len( cData ) ) ) > 0
            cOutPut += SubStr( cData, 1, nLen )
            cData := Space( 1000 )
         ENDDO

         IF !hb_ProcessIsRunning( hProc, 0 )
            EXIT
         ENDIF
         IF ( hb_milliseconds() - nStart ) > 30 * 1000
            // Kill process
            HB_ProcessClose( hProc )
         ENDIF
      ENDDO
      HB_ProcessValue( hProc )

   ENDIF
RETURN

Without need to handle it in MT mode using another thread as I did in 
uhttpd and using above code in ST mode.
I looked at hbproces.c code and Windows (HB_IO_WIN) version I suppose 
could be this:

int hb_fsProcessIsRunning( HB_FHANDLE hProcess, DWORD dwTimeout )
{
    BOOL fRunning = FALSE;

    HB_TRACE(HB_TR_DEBUG, ("hb_fsProcessIsRunning(%p, %d)", ( void * ) ( 
HB_PTRDIFF ) hProcess, dwTimeout));

{
    DWORD dwResult;
    HANDLE hProc = ( HANDLE ) hb_fsGetOsHandle( hProcess );

    if( hProc )
    {
       hb_vmUnlock();
       dwResult = WaitForSingleObject( hProc, dwTimeout );
       if ( dwResult != WAIT_OBJECT_0 )
          fRunning = TRUE;
       hb_vmLock();
    }
    else
       hb_fsSetError( ( USHORT ) FS_ERROR );
}
    return fRunning;
}

and for hbprocfn.c

HB_FUNC( HB_PROCESSISRUNNING )
{
    HB_FHANDLE hProcess = hb_numToHandle( hb_parnint( 1 ) );

    if( hProcess != 0 && hProcess != FS_ERROR && ( hb_pcount() < 2 || 
ISNUM( 2 ) ) )
       hb_retni( hb_fsProcessValue( hProcess, ( hb_pcount() < 2 ? 0 : 
hb_parnint( 2 ) ) ) );
    else
       hb_errRT_BASE_SubstR( EG_ARG, 4001, NULL, HB_ERR_FUNCNAME, 
HB_ERR_ARGS_BASEPARAMS );
}

but for other OSes I don't know how handle it.

Could you kindly help me ?

TIA

Best Regards,
Francesco

I have tested code and, apart for two typos for returning values, it works.
Correct code is:

PROC Main()
   LOCAL hOut
   LOCAL hProc := hb_ProcessOpen( "test.exe",, @hOut, @hOut, .T. )
   LOCAL nStart := hb_milliseconds()
   LOCAL cDate, cOutPut, nLen

   IF hProc > -1

      DO WHILE .T.

         cData := Space( 1000 )
         cOutPut := ""
         DO WHILE ( nLen := Fread( hOut, @cData, Len( cData ) ) ) > 0
            cOutPut += SubStr( cData, 1, nLen )
            cData := Space( 1000 )
         ENDDO

         IF !hb_ProcessIsRunning( hProc, 0 )
            EXIT
         ENDIF

I prefer to store such data in resources on Windows.
Is there a way to set an icon from binary data ?:
     hb_GTInfo( HB_GTI_ICON, hb_MemoRead( "my.ico" ) )
     hb_GTInfo( HB_GTI_ICON, win_LoadResource( "MYICON", "MYIMGS" ) )

Such API would be much flexible than current Windows
specific ICONRES and limited ICONFILE.

BTW, .ico isn't very portable format, does gtqtc support
.png files as icons?

Brgds,
Viktor

Can I switch this feature (checks when _OPEN_ index ) to OFF ?
I must often read existing bases and indexes. I am aware of limitations.
Sample, I want open base from VFP and index with many TAGs, but
I use only one TAG correct read by Harbour and I use only seek and skip.

Subject: [Harbour] gt for linux
Message-ID: <49F19159.7020602@belacy.belgorod.su>

Hi All,

   for a few years I use for Harbour Linux console applications the 
gtcrs, but last time more and more new distributions goes with UTF8 
coding and gtcrs doesn't show national characters ( possibly, ncursesw 
should be used instead of ncurses, but this is other issue ).

   Which gt can I use now with distributions, based on UTF8, to see 
national characters properly ?

   I've tried gtxwc, but, most likely, I've missed something, and 
cyrillic characters was showed incorrectly, too. SO the second question 
is - what I need to set ( codepage, font, something other ... ) to see 
cyrillic letters properly with gtxwc ?

Regards, Alexander.

In the past I created GTCRW but I haven't committed it due to ncursesw
limitations for which I have to create a lot of workarounds. With current
GT model it can be implemented much easier but I do not know if it's worth
to invest time for it. See below.

1. GTTRM it's terminal GT which does not use curses or slang and does not
   use termcap/terminfo database. It supports only few most popular terminals
   XTERM/LINUX/ANSI.
   It automatically detects UTF8/ISO terminal mode and works well with both.
   It also should work well as simple GTSTD as long as you do not use some
   full screen command but will operate only on console output.
   Probably GTTRM is the best as default choice until you do not have to
   use some exotic terminals or some seldom used *nix ports.

2. GTSLN with slang 1.4.x + Unicode patches or with slang2 which has native
   support for UTF8. GTSLN supports both slang versions.

You have to inform GT driver about codepage you are using in your source
GT output so it can make conversion to unicode values. See HB_SETTERMCP()

   2006-02-04 17:05 UTC+0100 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)
   [...]
         The new three .prg functions:
            HB_SETKEYCP( <cTermCP> [,<cHostCP>] )
            HB_SETDISPCP( <cTermCP> [,<cHostCP>] [,<lBoxChar>] )
            HB_SETTERMCP( <cTermCP> [,<cHostCP>] [,<lBoxChar>] )
         have been added. They set automatic input (HB_SETKEYCP)
         and output (HB_SETDISPCP) (or both: HB_SETTERMCP) character
         translation. They are also important for some GTs which
         informing them about used internal code page for unicode
         translation (GTXWC, GTSLN) and/or chosing proper character
         set (standard/alternate) for letters and other (f.e. box
         drawing characters) (GTCRS, GTSLN),
            <cTermCP> is encoding used on external (terminal) side
            <cHostCP> is encoding used internally, if not given then
                      current code page set HB_SETCODEPAGE() is used.
                      some of GTs which uses unicode output may
                      ignore <cTermCP>
            <lBoxChar> is optional parameter which interacts with dispbox()
                       output disabling switching to alternate character
                       set in some GTs. It effectively causes that if internal
                       (host) code page contains some letters on the box char
                       positions then they will be shown also by box drawing
                       functions like dispbox() instead of CP437 characters.
                       In some cases it could be useful. By default lBoxChar
                       is not set and GTs which can switch between standard
                       and alternate character set (GTCRS, GTSLN) will try to
                       use alternate character set for box drawing functions.

To the above list of GTs you should add GTTRM (added later) and Unicde builds
of some windows only GTs like GTWVT.
Probably in your case it will be enough to make sth like:
   HB_SETTERMCP( "RUISO", "RUISO" )

You can change it in the RDD source and remove the RTE call but for CDX
is very bad idea. In CDX format key expression type is not stored inside
index header file and can be determinated only by key evaluation.
Without expression type RDD will not know how to convert keys for some
operations like seek so they can give incorrect results.

seek will not work for indexes like the one you sent few days ago
because user value will have to be hashed by windows API function
before used inside index. Try the example I sent with ordKeyVal()
using current SVN Harbour code. It shows that keys in index are not
stored directly but modified by not revertible function. See in MSDN
what LCMapString() with LCMAP_SORTKEY does in Windows.

Hi,

Perhaps you can to define your index function in your harbour program,
example

FUNCTION IndexFunc()
RETURN ""

Function will return type mismatch real clipper function

Here last fread() returned 0 so the process has just finished execution.
It's not necessary to use hb_ProcessIsRunning() because hOut PIPE is using
blocking IO.

You never reach this place because hb_ProcessIsRunning() should always
return FALSE.

Maybe in real windows some thins works in different way but for me it looks
that you are trying to make sth different then you really need.
This is your code modified to work as self contain example.

   request HB_GT_CGI_DEFAULT
   proc main(x)
      local hOut, hProc, cData, nLen
      if x == nil
         hProc := hb_ProcessOpen( hb_progname() + " X",, @hOut, @hOut, .T. )
         if hProc != -1
            ? "process open"
            cData := Space( 1000 )
            while  ( nLen := Fread( hOut, @cData, Len( cData ) ) ) > 0
               ? "read[" + left( cData, nLen ) + "]"
            enddo
            ? "nLen = 0 -> process finished with exit code:", ;
              HB_ProcessValue( hProc )
            ?
         endif
      else
         for nLen := 1 to 5
            outstd( "line " + hb_ntos( nLen ) )
            hb_idleSleep( 0.3 )
         next
         outstd( "EOF" )
         errorlevel( 57 )
      endif
   return

It should show if hOut is using blocking IO or not.
BTW PIPEs without blocking IO are usually very hard to use so if they are
not blocking calling process in windows we should try to fix it.

Similar functionality but without timeout parameter:

   function hb_ProcessIsRunning( hProc )
   return hb_processValue( hPorc, .f. ) != -1

But I think that for final application you need sth different and the
above request is result of some current behavior misunderstanding.

It prints:
=======================================
C:\cawi32\sample\test>test152.exe

process open
read[line 1]
read[line 2]
read[line 3]
read[line 4]
read[line 5]
read[EOF]
nLen = 0 -> process finished with exit code:         57

=======================================
So, I guess, everything is OK with Windows pipes.

Subject: [Harbour] Some xhb developers giving no credit when copying work
	from Harbour
Message-ID: <18d502870904240534u6728518t1dbc975dab98ec23@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I wanted to raise this topic for some time, it's a quite sad one
(especially on such a nice sunny Friday as today) so
I was holding it off, but lately Miguel Angel Marchuet again copied
work from Harbour without giving any credit whatsoever to original
authors. Around last month I've also found copy/pasted text from my
own Harbour Changelog entry on the commercial version of xhb
changes pags. Related e-mails thanked above changes to all those
wonderful *xhb* developers. I'm not one of them (still banned), not
wanting to be one, but all this doesn't mean they are not making
benefit of these works, and even earning money out of it. So, IMO
the least thing is to mention Harbour's or authors' name (even if it
happens to be me) name (spelled correctly) when advertising such things.

Current practice is more than misleading for both paying or non-paying
users of these products and quite insulting for those developers who
actually spend months with features and see them like this. Since this
is simply an unmanly thing and probably doesn't break any legal license,
I'm considering changing all my licensed files with a new item requiring
mention of my name when using my work, but before I do I'd like
to sync my views with others.

[ I don't even mention that among all the Harbour developers names
on xhb developer page, mine is accidentally left out. Quite strange
if we consider that 30% of all commits were done by me (vszakats/vszel). ]

To make it clear I have no problem xhb copying my work or even
selling it (as far as they comply to license), but I'd like to see my
name appearing when appropriate.

Worth mentioning that I've asked this from Miguel and Patrick, so
far without any results (besides Miguel correcting one entry with
my misspelled name, which isn't very polite).

If you have any opinion on this, please add it here, before doing such
action it'd be also nice to hear some xhb opinions.

Brgds,
Viktor

IMHO this is your right to do that but see below.

IMHO you can just report it to Enrico Maria Giordano who manages the
page, and he will add your name.

IMHO this lack of results is a sad accident.

IMHO every such case can be easily resolved by communicating with the
person who forgot to mention your name. Adding a requirement to
mention your name won't change anything by itself.

I understand your position but this can "potentially" create problems.
IANAL but distros like Debian and Fedora read carefully licenses and
this could exclude Harbour from official repositories. IIRC the fork
of xfree86 began with an issue like that: they wanted their name
mentioned.

So I'd suggest to evaluate the issue with experts.

Lorenzo

most of above modifications is direct COPY and PAST of Harbour source code
files modified to compile with xHarbour header files.
As I can see in the ChangeLog it's not the 1-st time when you are not
leaving any information about the source of your commits when in practice
nearly each of them was based on code borrowed from Harbour.
I hope that you will update all your ChangeLog entries and will remember
about it in the future.

best regards,
Przemek

ps. I think that you should discuss such modifications with xHarbour
    developers before commit. Harbour uses different logic for timestamp
    items. It has different arithmetic and relational operators behavior
    in HVM and native RDDs were updated to respect it. You ported to xHarbour
    only RDD part what is technical nonsense because now the RDD results of
    some operations like seek or scope positioning can give incompatible to
    HVM results, f.e. this code can show "corrupted index" for ascending
    index on timestamp value:
         seek( dDate )
         if ordKeyVal() < dDate
            ? "corrupted index"
         endif
    If you want to introduce it to xHarbour then you should 1-st agree
    the behavior in the whole code and modifications in HVM/RTL. Probably
    you will need Walter help here.

Yes it is. These are expected results, the same as in *nixes and I hope
in OS2.

This code is generated by bison. To pacify the above warning
I will have to add some dummy code. I do not know if it's good idea here.
I'll look at it but if the cost of introducing dummy destructors for
terminal symbol will cause RT overhead then I'll do not add them.

No. This is the 1-st real bug in our source code shown by extended MSVC
messages and the warning message is very precise. It's quite common mistake
when I have to switch between C and .prg code - the ! operator has
different precedence. The correct line is:
      if( pToken->len != 3 || pToken->value[2] != '0' )

Thanks for the info. I'll commit fix ASAP.

This is why, I switched xHarbour to Harbour!

In real app runtime, I searched one bug reported by my client.
DBSeek not working properly!

I will try to explain:

// REGISTER MAG->LOCOB EXISTS AND POSITIONED HERE!!
Sele MAG
Seek DOC->LOCOB          // I.E. SEEK Would not necessarily
If Found()                    // NOT FOUND???? WHY? HOW?
   // process
Endif

Seek dont?t found a register (MAG->LOCOB) existing and positioned with 
key equal DOC->LOCOB
in other words
Very bad!

Sorry for my bad english.

Best regards,

Hi Lorenzo,

Thanks for raising this aspect.

We can say that using any of the material inside another
projects in source form will need a mention of the project's name.
This doesn't seem very restrictive for anyone who'd
like to bundle the whole project to another one (like a Linux
distro, MinGW compiler or whatever). We can even mention
forks. Of course this may not be compatible with some
hard-core free software evangelists' views, although this isn't
sure either because giving credit is high on their list in certain
copyright related topics. My aim would be to get credit when
parts of source and text is cherry picked and copied into
other projects, certainly not when whole Harbour Project is
used in any legally allowed form.

My other option is to specifically prohibit certain types of projects  or
specific projects from using my work. I'll think about these.

Given that I made exactly zero amount of money from Harbour
so far, I certainly don't intend to employ an expert to solve
this specific problem, rather I hope we can get to some conclusion
here, or I may ask FSF for advice, or do the best I can on
my own judgement.

Brgds,
Viktor

[ let me add it's not only my name of course but any developer's
name, and Harbour's name. This doesn't change the point, just to
make it clear. ]

Unfortunately I've seen dozens of such commits throughout the
last ~1.5 years, for some time I also thought it as an accident, but
for me it looks way too consistent to be it, best case it's disrespectful
and negligent, if not outright personal. Giving credit should be an
automatic act, but after being warned I guess it's not too much to
expect from someone developing such complicated pieces as RDDs
and a language's core.

As I've said I've tried to no avail, otherwise I wouldn't use this space to
discuss such embarrassing topics. I've included this complaint to
Miguel numerous times (causing one wrong correction, the rest ignored),
wrote to Patrick (as xhb project leader and part of the start up team),
can't remember any answer. All this for something which is routine for
you, for me and fortunately most developers I know in both projects.

If the license doesn't change anything, we probably shouldn't have one at
all, so I hope we agree that it's there to use it :) no offence meant.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Przemek,
Yes, I saw your message. I've now read a few replies.

Ron is probably referring to the hb_retc_buffer() and friends situation,
which was developed by me in my local repository without looking into
any xhb source or employing methods used there (you have to take my
word for it, or look up commits or committed code from this period, or
look into actual implementations). Now, Ron is complaining that the two
APIs aren't compatible. Well, exactly, because my intent wasn't to
replicate *anything* present in xhb, (first off because I've never looked
into
the implementation, or even the scope of the feature), just to implement
a good idea in Harbour the best way I could. BTW, this happened after
the split and it took me about 5 years to look into xhb source tree the
first time.

The only connection to Ron and xhb is that I've read the Harbour list
and saw the function name hb_retc[len]Adopt() in one of the messages
(on 2002. Jan 23) which sparked the idea of implementing these new API
functions in Harbour, without ever knowing more than these two names,
the idea is quite simple and logical, and ideas cannot be copyrighted.

So, even this example of not giving credit is unfounded, and there isn't
any other example in the whole life of Harbour anybody could pull.

See these two commits for comparison:
Harbour:
2002-01-30 09:30 UTC+0100 Antonio Linares <alinares@fivetech.com>
xhb / ChangeLog.013:
2001-12-29 17:16 UTC-0800 Ron Pinkas <ron@ronpinkas.com>

Brgds,
Viktor

Minor correction: The *crew list* is only linked since me initiating
a private e-mail conversation with Ron to get this link added to this
page. There wasn't a link to Harbour page before. My name also missing,
and I didn't even want to mention it, instead I felt linking to our crew
page solves to problem adequately for everyone (and a bit more
personally than sf.net member list). And to the credit of Ron, he added
it. This was in 2005 (confirmed from archives.org).

Anyway, thanks for adding it.

[ The link is now broken after our page changes, a .htm needs to be
changed to .html in the link:
http://www.harbour-project.org/crew.html ]

Vailton, if you read this, maybe we could readd the .htm alias/redirect
to fix this on our side.

Brgds,
Viktor

Can you precisely define what you are talking about?
I was talking things like xbase++ multivalue macros which you started
in Harbour then continued your work on then in xHarbour and you never
finished ot so they are still broken after over 6 years of xHarbour life.
But in Harbour they are implemented in absolutely different way and they
are working. I do not agree that someone will discard my work saying that
it comes from something what never worked correctly and cannot work well
due to fatal design decision. I had to create it from scratch because
alternative was dropping completely this idea to not keep broken and
not working code.
I was talking about simplex which were and still is broken because it's
wrongly designed from the beginning what Ryszard shows before xHarbour
started. In Harbour there is no even single line from this idea and the
same will have to happen in xHarbour if someone will want to fix it.
I was talking about FOR EACH, WITH OBJECT implementation which does not
come from xHarbour at all. The Harbour version does not have even single
line from xHarbour code and the names does not comes from xHarbour too.
The only one thing which comes directly from xHarbour is : inside
WITH OBJECT what causes some serious problem to other code and PP rules
and we have to leave with them :-(
I was talking about TRY / CATCH which still does not work correctly, etc.
BTW Your idea to use ALWAYS clause inside BEGIN SEQUENCE was great for me
and I implemented it in Harbour.
In Harbour all of the above were implemented in different way which does
not cause side effects and runtime overheads. The results you can see
in speedtst.prg - Harbour which now supports more features in which
some "xHarbour extensions: works but do not work in xHarbour is also
nearly twice faster in pure PCODE evaluation then xHarbour. And I'm
talking about ST mode. In the MT mode the difference is much bigger
but the speed is the less important problem of xHarbour MT mode ...

> As far as I know, xHarbour does not include any idea borrowed from Harbour, 

Not true. A lot of my code I 1-st committed to Harbour and later was ported
to xHarbour. PP, -gc3, many modifications in compiler and HVM, RDDs.
Later a lot of my code was borrowed from Harbour but it's the fact that
Miguel does not use to inform about the source of his commits, f.e. if we
are talking about "xHarbour ideas" some basic fixes for FOR EACH /
WITH OBJECT / TRY CATCH in compiler like:
   2007-08-22 11:45 UTC+0100 Miguel Angel Marchuet <miguelangel/at/marchuet.net>
   2007-08-22 12:12 UTC+0100 Miguel Angel Marchuet <miguelangel/at/marchuet.net>
were committed without any information about their source.
Do you see any information that the solution is copied from Harbour?
Or:
   2007-10-31 10:00 UTC+0100 Miguel Angel Marchuet <miguelangel/at/marchuet.net>
Do you think the the line
   Synced with harbour as possible.
is enough in this case?
In this case 99% of the commit is my code copied from Harbour and there is no
even single note about it.
And then you are saying that you do not know anything about code borrowed
from Harbour.
You also do not like to refer to the source of some of your modifications,
f.e.:
   2009-03-13 23:58 UTC-0430 Ron Pinkas <ron.pinkas/at/xharbour.com>
it's my Harbour solution:
   2006-08-19 01:10 UTC+0200 Przemyslaw Czerpak (druzus/at/priv.onet.pl)
adopted to xHarbour source code and it was in few days after my message
to this list where I informed you what is wrong and that you should refer
to Harbour source code for proper solution.
Here we have yet another funny thing. In this modifications you used
extension which also comes from Harbour source code but probably where
wrongly ported and in the past you modified. Of course everything without
information from where it comes and what it does.
But at leas in your last commit you haven't copied Harbour source code as is.
Unlike FOR EACH / WITH OBJECT etc. which are not patented xHarbour names
and such construction were added to xHarbour I'm talking about direct coping
of source code or algorithms without even single credit note to original
authors or projects. I understand that sometime is hard to check who exactly
committed sth so I understand that it's hard to refer original author.
But I do not understand that it's possible to copy ~250 lines of my Changelog
entry removing my name from it.
I do not talk about your or mine imaginations or feelings but only about
the facts.

It was my goal in the past to keep support for both compilers and I was
making it for really long time but in current days IMHO it's not worth
to longer invest time in xHarbour. It does not offer any interesting
functionality, it's much slower, some important things does not work at
all and it's very hard to force some deeper modifications by main door.

OK. I also end this subject.
I only hope that Miguel with update his ChangeLog entries from last years.

in opinion of most guru ( Bedi, Przemyslaw) that Harbour  is today
superior (fast and reliable)  to xharbour
but why not try the way of join either team
Przemyslaw is very able to define a long term way (netrdd,gtnet) with
more resource we will  have a faster/better result
But the question  also for Rom and [x]Harbour Team which proposal is
acceptable for join two team?
they need a compatibility library
We have a common dream, why not join effort for it
Abbiamo un sogno comune, perch? non realizzarlo insieme

Hi Przemek and Mindaugas,

thank you for explanation and for tests, but I was too fast in writing
and I did few tests so I didn't saw that hOut PIPE is using blocking IO.

What I need is to run an application and kill it if it uses more time
than necessary or hangs.
I'm writing an application that has to run on some PCs in an unattended
way and it has to run some external applications to make some upgrades.
Because I don't know the state of these PCs there is the possibility
that some of those applications will not complete themselves or will use
too much time and I need to kill them.
In MT mode I think that I have found a correct solution as I implemented
in uhttpd (but if you have time please check me looking at CGIExec /
CGIKill functions), but some of those PCs have Win 9x installed and MT
is not supported (application built on Vista give error probably due to 
some missing dependency in Win9x and I would like to have same 
executable for all platforms) so I thought to try using ST mode.
But I miss blocking IO (I thought that was not blocking) and also wrote 
some errors in code I posted.

Now I have done more extensive tests (I hope enough) and I have seen 
that I cannot use FRead() version because if application doesn't write 
something (in case it write anything or hangs) it will wait forever.
So the code should be (I have modified your sample):

    request HB_GT_CGI_DEFAULT
    proc main(x)
       local hOut, hProc, cData, nLen
       LOCAL nStart

       if x == nil

          ? "starting process"
          hProc := hb_ProcessOpen( hb_progname() + " X",,,, .T. )
          if hProc != -1

             ? "process open"
             nStart := hb_milliseconds()

             while .t.
                ? "Checking application status: "
                IF hb_ProcessIsRunning( hProc, 1000 )
                   ?? " Process is running"
                   IF ( hb_milliseconds() - nStart ) > 10 * 1000
                      ? "Killing process"
                      HB_ProcessClose( hProc )
                      EXIT
                   ENDIF
                ELSE
                   ?? " Process is NOT running"
                   EXIT
                ENDIF
             enddo
             ? "process finished with exit code: "
             ?? HB_ProcessValue( hProc )
             ?
          endif
       else
          for nLen := 1 to 5
             outstd( "line " + hb_ntos( nLen ) )
             hb_idleSleep( 3 )
          next
          outstd( "EOF" )
          errorlevel( 57 )
       endif
    return

and in this case result is:

-------
J:\cvs\harbourSVN_trunk\tests>tstkillapp1

starting process
process open
Checking application status:  Process is running
Checking application status:  Process is running
Checking application status:  Process is running

Checking application status:  Process is running
Checking application status:  Process is running
Checking application status:  Process is running
Checking application status:  Process is running
Killing process
process finished with exit code:          0
-------

where hb_ProcessIsRunning() I have changed to:

    FUNCTION hb_ProcessIsRunning( hProc, nTimeout )
       LOCAL lIsRunning := ( HB_ProcessValue( hProc, .f. ) == -1 )
       IF HB_ISNUMERIC( nTimeout ) .AND. nTimeout > 0
          hb_idleSleep( nTimeout / 1000 )
       ENDIF
    RETURN lIsRunning


I hope this mail could be useful to others.
Thank you for your time and I will appreciate if you will tell me if it 
is correct or there are other ways to implement it in ST mode.

Best Regards,
Francesco

Hi,


I've put some hands on OLE again - added FOR EACH enumeration support. 
Though, OLE does not support backward iteration. Should we ignore 
backward (descending) iteration flag and do forward iteration, should we 
do not iterate at all (current behavior), or should we give runtime 
error (which one?)?

I've tried to run contrib/hbole/tests/testole.prg code and work a little 
for missing features. One of the first is array access operator.

It can easy be implemented by adding:
    ...
    METHOD __Index( nIndex )   OPERATOR "[]"
ENDCLASS

METHOD __Index( nIndex ) CLASS HB_OLEAUTO
RETURN ::Item( nIndex )

The feature is available in current code also, i.e. I can write:
   oWorkbook:WorkSheets:Item(1)
Of cause
   oWorkbook:WorkSheets[1]
looks more friendly, but don't we invent something new in OLE world. 
I've tried to write a simple .vbs script. Visual basic does not accept
   oWorkbook:WorkSheets[1]
It does accept:
   oWorkbook:WorkSheets(1)
but this work also in current hbole implementation. That is array access 
syntax in VB? Does it work for OLE collections?

Ok, I can add the 3 lines and make a support for array access operation.
If you'll look to win_tole.prg, you'll see that implementation is more 
complex than 3 lines proposed by me, it tries to handle array assign. It 
tries to do it in two ways: using :_Item(), and using :SetItem(). If you 
look to ICollection documentation you'll not find any of these 
collection item assignment ways documented. ICollection supports Item(), 
AddAt(), AddItem() methods, but no SetItem(). This is why, I do not want 
to implement these array assignment syntax. But do we need array access 
syntax? How does it work on OLE automation object in other languages?

Good, this is more simple.

hb_pcount() returns int and can be negative, then if hb_pcount return 
-1, por exemple, will occur a underflow
and usPCount will be USHORT_MAX - 1????

In this case:

   /* decode parameters */
   if( usPCount )   // always TRUE if usPCount underflow!!
   {


Maybe is better declare usPCount int.

eval.c:
line 422:    int usPCount = hb_pcount();   // prevent underflows in 
return of hb_pcount

The above warning message is the side effect of C compiler logic
limitation. In this line:
   pItem->item.asRecover.flags = HB_SEQ_DOALWAYS |
                                 ( bCanRecover ? HB_SEQ_CANRECOVER : 0 );
only constant values are used and they never cannot exceed USHORT.
But internally the result of ( USHORT | USHORT ) is converted to int
and then warning message is generated. In fact here we have two things
which should be improved fixed in MSVC.
1. detect that the value is result of bit operation on some smaller values
   which cannot exceed the size of result
2. add some pseudo constant detection with list of possible values which can
   be used in optimization. In this case compiler can detect that the result
   can be HB_SEQ_DOALWAYS or ( HB_SEQ_DOALWAYS | HB_SEQ_CANRECOVER )
   and both values can be perfectly sored in USHORT.

Implementing any of the above in C compiler should fix this false warning
message. Now we can only add some unnecessary decoration (explicit casting)
to pacify this warning. I only want to notice that if you increase the
warning messages over some resonable limit in such compilers then we begin
to introduce casting which will hide the real bugs, f.e.:

   pItem->item.asRecover.flags = ( USHORT ) ( HB_SEQ_DOALWAYS |
                                 ( bCanRecover ? HB_SEQ_CANRECOVER : 0 ) );

will pacify warnings even if someone by mistake change HB_SEQ_DOALWAYS or
HB_SEQ_CANRECOVER to value larger then USHRT_MAX. It means that we will
have less readable code and less safe. Please remember about it and use
some reasonable warning limits in compilers which produce too much of false
alarms. Otherwise we begin to strongly reduce code quality. F.e. even now
I think that a lot of casting we added to pacify bit losing conversion
warning messages will badly hide possible errors when we begin to convert
basic types. Explicit casting of all expressions simply can hide important
bugs.

I agree with you!
We don?t have use a explicit casting!

But the case 1 still valid:

1. detect that the value is result of bit operation on some smaller values
   which cannot exceed the size of result

Mabye, a ASSERT is a resource for this!

I have tested sample I sent previous time but I get:
Error BASE/3012  Argument error: GETNAMESPACE
Called from HB_OLEAUTO:GETNAMESPACE(0)
Called from MAIN(37)

the version I tested is attached (same as before, but with WITH OBJECT 
commented that AFAIR currently is not supported).

Tell me if I can do some other tests.

Best Regards,
Francesco

Hi,


I have the same error on my side. I've fixed it (it appeared after I've 
implemented GC pointers). But the problem on my side is that I do not 
have Outlook. So, it could note resolve your problem. I'll try to find a 
computer some computer with Outlook.

Mindaugas

Perfect! Now it seems to works well also with WITH OBJECT version.
Just a small error:

? :Birthday := CToD( "23/05/2006" )

Returns NIL, instead it should returns assigned date
Think to
? dDate := :Birthday := CToD( "23/05/2006" )
in this case dDate is Nil.

? :Birthday                       // here it should return a date
correctly returns the assigned date.

Thank you!
I will make other test. (But tomorrow, now it's late)

Francesco

Well, the license DOES mean something. The GPL requires that copyrights 
are carried forward into the borrowed code. If you live in a country 
that signed the original Berne Convention, or has signed it since it's 
inception, your code is automatically copyrighted the moment you write 
it. The list of countries that didn't sign yet is quite small.

If you find a module of yours being distributed with your copyright 
removed, the copier has violated the GPL and has to get permission from 
you directly to distribute your code. This is clear in the GPL. This is 
one of the better things it does for us.

You have a right to license your code in many ways. One of the ways we 
license is via the GPL, which allows other people to borrow your code, 
but they have to follow the rules. If they don't follow the rules, you 
have not given them permission to distribute your code. You have the 
right to sue for profits created from this illegal distribution. This is 
one of the reasons I would like to see many modules copyrights donated 
to the FSF. They have lawyers to enforce such things.

But you are correct. The gentlemanly thing to do is to give credit to 
the author in downline GPL usage. If we use code from any other project 
and it is GPL code, I want everyone here to give credit and include the 
original copyright in our source tree. I suspect that every GPL project 
manager wants the same, but things happen without oversight or vision, 
so we may have to be vigilant and authoratative to get things set straight.

Let's give them some time to correct this and then you can give me 
examples and I'll take it up with their project manager.

And, yes, you are a MAJOR contributor to this project and you are very 
much appreciated as are all of our contributors.

I found the reason.

do while .t.
   if Inkey() == K_ESC
      EXIT
   endif
enddo

Inkey() without parameters is the culprit.
Changing it to inkey( 0.1 ) did the trick. 
I could not reproduce this problem in GTWVT.
So I assume the event dispatching by QT engine
is somewhat different than Windows itself.

Przemek, can we implement in Inkey() some very 
small value to release the CPU cycles ?

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

PS : To check above just change Inkey() to Inkey(0.1)
in the mainloop of wvtext.prg.

I have a very limited knowledge about this stuff :-).
But could you please explain why it seems so important to mention such
credits while people know that the codes which were borrowed (example:
RDD stuffs), by themselves already BEAR the complainer's CopyRight. I
could immediately understand if the borrower CHANGED the Copyright OR 
Copy/Paste the codes into a new file bearing the borrower's Copyright.

You missed the point, perhaps.
The whole issue is not revolving the source file,
but the declarations in the ChangeLog which pretends 
to the users that those changes were made by thou-self.

To give credit to the original author by no means 
degrade your stature, standing, expertise. Instead it portrays
your true professional innerself. It is a way of respect to the self. 
It shows your maturity and understanding of the things.
You never know when your code is going to be targetted like this.

I understand, once in a while it could be omission for minor updates,
but not for major ones.

BTW when I read the Changelog entry by Angel, I too felt the 
same way as is felt by Viktor and Przemek even before these
messages appear. What do you think what impression whole 
Harbour community could have gathered...

This is unfair IMO, you seem to hide under the condition "IDEA CANNOT BE
COPYRIGHTED" or are you declaring yourself a genius because you can
"implement" other's stuff into yours without taking a look and then
simply stated that it is a SIMPLE thing? :-)

I am not trying to be rude but I simply feel this is unjust :-)

Not true. Users can READ the file and WILL SEE who's codes it is (in
this case: Przemek). Users will not refers to ChangeLog to seek who
wrote the codes, but to the FILEs.

Furthermore, AFAIR there is no rule which governs PPL for putting
credits.

The following entries shows us how my idea was used in Harbour without
giving credits because "Idea Cannot Be CopyRighted". I know for sure the
codes are not mine but I can assure you that the "Idea" to implement it
in xHarbour was mine. This idea was first strongly rejected by Harbour
developers, but I found it now implemented in Harbour. I know I'm not
entitled to claim nor I am looking for "rewards" because truthfully I do
not expect it. If people can use my idea, I am a very happy man
eventhough it was implemented with many exceptions/comments. :-)

  * harbour/source/pp/ppcore.c
    ! fixed line number set for C preprocessor in #pragma begindump

  * harbour/include/hbcomp.h
  * harbour/source/compiler/hbmain.c
  * harbour/source/compiler/genc.c
    * added detection of static Harbour functions in #pragma begindump
      code. I do not like it because it cannot be well implemented on
      other then real C compiler/preprocessor level but it's probably
      better then different workarounds I see in some [x]Harbour 3-rd
      party projects.
      Warning this functionality is not officially supported. It's a hack
      to existing #pragma begindump hack and activated only for dumped C
      code. It tries to detect Harbour static functions declared by
      HB_FUNC_STATIC( name ) but it does not make any real C preprocessing.
      Only strips comments and strings and then looks for above statement
      dividing the code to some basic tokens so it will give wrong results
      for code like:

         #if 0
            HB_FUNC_STATIC( MYFUNC )
         #else
            HB_FUNC( MYFUNC )
         #endif
            {
               hb_retc( "MyFunc" );
            }

      but it works correctly for simple code which does not use conditional
      compilation and does not try to redefine HB_FUNC_STATIC() macro, f.e:

         proc main()
            ? YEAR( DATE() ), MONTH( DATE() ), DAY( DATE() ), TEST()
         return
         #pragma begindump
         #include "hbapi.h"
         /* are comments stripped? If not then HB_FUNC_STATIC( DATE )
            in comment can create troubles. */
         // HB_FUNC_STATIC( YEAR ) just like this one in C++ comments
         #define MYHB_FUNC_STATIC( fun )  #fun // to test whole word tokens
         /* COMMENT */HB_FUNC_STATIC( TEST )
         {
            hb_retc( "HB_FUNC_STATIC( DAY )->" MYHB_FUNC_STATIC( MONTH ) );
         }
         #pragma enddump

      Before we had wrong results for any code like:

            HB_FUNC_STATIC( MYFUNC )
            {
               hb_retc( "MyFunc" );
            }

      so it's not making anything worse (I hope ;-)).
      The implementation is intentionally local to -gc output to not
      effect other compiler code.

There is nothing unjust about it. It's been this way for decades if not 
centuries.

Expressions of things, song notes on paper, words on paper, computer 
code in files or on paper, etc. can be copyrighted. If you derive 
something from copyrighted work, it is still copyrighted by the original 
author, not at all by the person who derived it. Even the changed parts 
are copyrighted by the original author no matter who does the changes. 
This is known as a derivative work. If you start from a clean paper or 
file and type or write the entire thing, you own the copyright. If you 
start with someone elses code and make changes, the other person still 
owns the copyright on the entire work. This is what makes the GPL work. 
When the original author licenses code through the GPL, he agrees that 
you can distribute it, modify it and use it, but you can't change the 
copyright and you can't change the licensing terms.

Ideas are not expressions of things. Ideas are esoteric, thus there is a 
different system evolved around protecting them. Patents protect ideas. 
Not copyrights.

And unlike copyright, where copyright is automatic when you express 
something, patents are not automatic.

In the free world, most countries have agreed on this structure of 
limits and protections. This is far beyond a gentlemen's agreement.

In many cases the source code files does not have any copyright notice
about the authors of modifications and extensions and you can check it
only in the ChangeLog.
I was working on nearly the whole Harbour core code and I do not used to
leave in header of each touched source file copy of the ChangeLog
entry with my copyrights. I thought that ChangeLog entries are enough.
There are files were 90% of code is mine but they are copyrighted
by someone else. Now in xHarbour there is no reference to original
authors at all, f.e. few weeks ago Patrick asked what HB_STRTOEXP() does.
It's my function and I checked it was copied from Harbour to xHarbour.
I wrote a message to Patrick explaining what it does but can you tell me
where is the information in the whole xHarbour repository that I'm the
author of this code?
If you want then you can find many other similar situations. F.e.
can you tell me where in xHarbour source code is any information
about original author of OSCodePage extension?
If someone does not carefully watch Harbour repository then he cannot
know the original authors or even what some code does and why it was added.
xHarbour CVS does not contain any information about them.

Well, you can try to paint me anything, but one fact doesn't change:
I didn't look into any xhb code, nor did I look into any implementation
details, only these *two function names*. Maybe I'm a genius like
you say, but I rather think we just came to the same conclusion, and
implemented it in parallel. I bet that the idea of a lexical parser wasn't
the idea of Ron, nor was FOR EACH a unique idea never implemented
anywhere else in the world before. Same thing. Besides it isn't very
complicated indeed, enough to look into the code (did you check it?),
at least my implementation is.

Anyway if I need to give credit to Ron for an xhb member posting the
text "hb_retcAdopt()" to Harbour's developer list, I hereby give it to him.
Thanks for *inspiring* hb_retc*_buffer().

BTW ideas can be *patented* AFAIK.

Brgds,
Viktor

Authors do, plus you never know who else does, I seek this information
a lot of times, since it can give a lot of information about what to expect
about a contribution. [ How would you think Linus Torvalds could decide
about a submitted kernel patch without knowing who submitted it? ]

Copyright is there, yes, but after all these years we all know that many
files have changed completely since their original author initially
submitted
it into the source tree.

F.e. I do lots of, lots of code cleanups and fixing, none of these makes
me a Copyright holder, yet it's tons of (I hope valuable) work and
contributes
to the final quality / state of the software. Do you think this work is
nothing
and should be hidden? Or even more: Do you think it's fair for someone
else to attribute these changes as his own?


> Furthermore, AFAIR there is no rule which governs PPL for putting

There is: Respect, correctness and attention to other developers and their
work.

Yes it is. You added code with similar functionality to xHarbour.
I do not like this extension and I do not like that you have made it.
As the result some 3-rd party projects begin to use :-( it and it was
a problem in porting their code to Harbour so I decided to add such
extension though I still think it's bad idea.
Unfortunately I was not able to use xHarbour code. Just simply
I created small test code you can find in the ChangeLog with few
different bad cases which should be resolved by code:

      proc main()
         ? YEAR( DATE() ), MONTH( DATE() ), DAY( DATE() ), TEST()
      return
      #pragma begindump
      #include "hbapi.h"
      /* are comments stripped? If not then HB_FUNC_STATIC( DATE )
         in comment can create troubles. */
      // HB_FUNC_STATIC( YEAR ) just like this one in C++ comments
      #define MYHB_FUNC_STATIC( fun )  #fun // to test whole word tokens
      /* COMMENT */HB_FUNC_STATIC( TEST )
      {
         hb_retc( "HB_FUNC_STATIC( DAY )->" MYHB_FUNC_STATIC( MONTH ) );
      }
      #pragma enddump

And tried to compile it using xHarbour.
It immediately exploited the problems in xHarbour.
AFAIR xHarbour is not able to correctly detect any of danger situation
in the above test code.
So I decided to not copy it from xHarbour but implement it myself
with some basic support for tokens. This implementation works correctly
and I think that xHarbour can benefit from it. If not they you should
update xHarbour to pass correctly above test.

In this particular case I many times wrote that it's very bad extension
and I haven't changed my opinion. IMHO it's only the source of problem
and I presented it on this and other forums many times so I though that
direct reference to you as the author of this idea will not be pleasure
for you. Looks that I was wrong. Of course I'll update the ChangeLog entry
and add an message that the idea of parsing the code inside #pragma begindump
to detect static C function was 1-st time implemented by Andi Jahja in
xHarbour.
Anyhow here I haven't took any source code or algorithms from xHarbour
so it's not comparable situation but I think it's good practice to make
leave such information especially now when I know that you have nothing
against binding your name with with extension.

I'm afriad it's not possible.
Inkey() release CPU only when called with some timeout parameter or 0.
Adding CPU release code to each inkey() call can kill the performance
of some which makes sth like:

   while !eof() and inkey()!=K_ESC
      [...]
      dbskip()
   enddo

because on some system the minimal interval can be quite huge, f.e.
10 milliseconds so in the above example skipping throw 1000 records
will took 10 seconds only for process sleeping.

I still haven't working environment with new Qt4.5.
In my systems the Qt is important part of the whole system
and I cannot easy add new Qt library without interactions
with existing binaries so I cannot make any tests yet with
final application. So far I only made some basic compilation
tests with Qt4.4 I have in my system but I cannot run final
binaries due to GPF.
I do not know what is the exact problem but the main difference
between inkey() and inkey(0.1) is activating idle proc. One of
jobs made by idle proc is exacting garbage collector. Maybe you
can reach the effect you are looking for by direct executing
hb_gcAll( .f. ).

Alternate line colors is IMHO a very useful feature that can be used
in every gt.
With 1.0+ we can better control colors so we can get a very
"professional" effect.

What I'm trying to achieve is an "automatic" alternate row background
that don't need the use of the column's color block.

Suggestions? Ideas?

P.S. it has to work with standard GTs like gttrm,gtxwc,gtwvt

vtg ? 

USE only WvgMenuBar() WvgMenu() classes only 
as these will be standard in the future and will go in hbqtxbp also.

It is easy but must go to Tbrowse core.

We need to find a way to add non Clipper compatible
extensions to classes in a clean way. So far my only
idea here is to subclass and add extensions there,
maybe others have something better in mind.

Extending existing classes creates very difficult to
detect portability problems, so we should be careful
about this.

Viktor

Why not an hb_Tbrowse class that subclass original class adding extensions ?

Hi Enrico,

I'm not surprised, good to see that xhb group so nicely
cleared the "accident" theory. If bending the past (aka
lying) is needed to get your group (or its upper management's?)
ego straight, this is probably a good move.

For me it's funny xhb group need to do such thing while using
lots of methodologies/schemes/functions to this day,
proposed/introduced/developed by me, yet you have to get yourself
comfortable by denying my existence.

Hopefully such approach will have a good effect on the public
image of xhb both as part of the free software community and
also as a commercial company seeking trust on the market.

Anyhow I only raised this issue to show and example for lack
of credit, but re-adding my name certainly wasn't among the
points of this thread, so let's move back on to topic.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi

>Exactly what I had in mind.

This almost requires a rewrite of almost all the methods
of TBrowse just rendering subclassing futile. It is because
of DispOut | DispOutAt methods scattered all over. 
In the past I had suggested to corner these calls to a 
method of Tbrowse but the idea was declined, probably,
for the reason of performance, because of one more 
layer to GT calls.

I plan this extension for GTQTC++ family of GT's.

BTW Tbrowse class is fairly stable at this moment so we can 
take a chance to organise it as above and then subclass to 
hb_Tbrowse. Then it will be only a couple of methods to 
rewrite in subclass .

But why would we need to change all DispOut*() calls in order to implement
some alternate method of coloring as Lorenzo
suggested?

Implementing TBrowse for GUI platforms is IMO a completely
different topic and it'd probably need a more serious rewrite
(a GUI clone) just like ALERT() and friends.

We already have xpp_TBrowse and we already have some
extended stuff disabled by default in a few classes which could
well go into such hb_<Clipperclass> classes. It's even possible
(if justified) to add extended stuff to core class internals, what we
must be careful of is to add all new *public* methods and variables
to hb_* flavour to leave the original public interface intact.

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] QT - GTQTC - List of Pending Features
Message-ID: <23238985.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello Everybody

GTQTC is almost matching with GTWVT 
except for the following features:

1) Cannot access SysMenu to initiate HB_GTI_SELECTCOPY 
    text and operation. 
    =>
    Instead drag the mouse over console while left button is pressed.

2) Funtion Tone() just beeps once. It does not take care of 
   duration and frequency.

3) More synchronization of BOX | LINE characters.
   Currently characters marked with "BOX" attribute in 
   relevant calls are displayed correctly. 
   At present B_SINGLE and B_DOUBLE_SINGLE box-characters
   are implemented. Rest as and when time may permit.

Please complete the above list and play with it.

Perhaps it is the time to move forward for GTWVG and HBQTXBP.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

Hi Leonardo,
hwgui defines a public symbol already defined in hbct.

I'd consider this a bug in hwgui, where DELETEFILE()
should either be renamed or moved to a separate source file.

Viktor

I'm sorry for this but please don't pull me towards your pueril and sterile 
debate. I follow and like both projects from the beginning and I'm only

Hi Viktor,

this function. Hwgui not found anything in that is using this function
DELETEFILE ().

Hi Viktor,

So I decided that even commenting this function in Hwgui. But now I'm having
another problem is that the LIB hbblat.lib which is giving the error below:

hbblat.lib(blatwrp.obj) : error LNK2019: s?mbolo externo "int __cdecl
cSend(char *)" (?cSend@@YAHPAD@Z) sin resolver al que se hace referencia en
la funci?n _HB_FUN_HB_BLATSEND

I am generating the blat.lib starting the blat.dll thus:

\bcc55\bin\impdef.exe blat.def blat.dll
lib /def:blat.def

I need to filter using a turbine in the DBF. The Harbor has something to
RMDBFCDX of xHarbour Commercial.

Note: At various points in my system already use ORDSCOPE () but in some
points have to do the filter and the active filter have to change the order
of display, then the ORDSCOPE () clean the filter when using a DBSETORDER ()
in ORDSCOPE a filter (), in case I'm using SET FILTER TO, but this filter is
known to many records is slow and this is where I want to give a better
optimized.

    + Implemented destructors. Now opening/closing new windows
      release memory properly. There is a small leakage remains yet,
      about 40 kb per window, but I am not been able to figure out
      what action causes it. May be in future...
    ! Optimized "Mark & Copy" operation. Now previous buffer is used 
      instead of creating a new image.
    ! "Mark & Copy" operation now do not generate INKEY() events.
      Important until we find a solution via SysMenu.

set filter optimised is strong for clipper application
basically you haven't any sample because simply you must create some
index on table then you made a set filter that instead read entire dbf
read only same part
You can use This technologies RMDBFCDX , BMDBFCDX
you can also try rddads that use sybase advantage data server or only
the free/local version

Hello Massimo,
Even took a look at the ADS, but it is not 100% free, and have different
types of clients where I have to buy a license for ADS.
I tried to compile with BCC using RMDBFCDX Harbour and gave the following
error: 

Error: Unresolved external '_HB_FUN_RMDBFCDX' referenced from
\WIN\BCC\SYSTEM.OBJ

Already with BMDBFCDX not the error, but not noticed differences in
performance when using filters of the type SET FILTER TO

Hi Leonardo,

Did you try building Harbour with HB_BUILD_IMPLIB=yes?
This way blat.lib will be generated for you automatically,
and hopefully in a usable form.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Pritpal,

I didn't have time to retest latest changes yet, I'll
do it in a few days.

For me two important point remains, both are showstoppers:
1) Missing codepage handling
2) Flicker / loss of window focus when doing certain operations.
    Keeping one of the F buttons pressed in WVTEST will eventually
    cause a switch to another app, but it's also visually confusing.

+1) Not showstopper, but definitely something to solve: Icon
     handling made interoperable thorough our GTs. Current
     HB_GTI_ICONRES isn't portable (not supported in GTQTC,
     for good reason), HB_GTI_ICONFILE isn't good because one
     must save that icon as a file before usage, which isn't ideal.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hello Viktor,

I was using the SIM SET HB_BUILD_IMPLIB = yes but when compiled with MSVC
the Harbour he led the LIB automatically, but my latest version of MSVC is a
little outdated, I will rebuild and come back to the results.

Hi Viktor,

Update the Harbour and recompile and generated the right of LIB Blat.
The problem now is that it generated the libpq.lib compiling with MSVC, and
did a test with the BCC and generated libpq.lib.
Any tips? 

I set environment variables is thus: 

set HB_COMPILER=msvc
set HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=d:\devel\hb-%HB_COMPILER%
set HB_BUILD_IMPLIB=yes
SET HB_INC_PGSQL=d:\pgsql\include
set HB_DIR_PGSQL=d:\pgsql
set HB_DIR_BLAT=D:\devel\blat262

Hi Massimo,

I use to compile my hbmk2 applications.
One problem that the ADS has some limitations for me is that problem. How to
access the applications by TS (Terminal Server). And to acquire a license is
not for me. Then tests with ADS not help me when I am looking for other
solutions such as BMDBFCDX. What I would like to know is how to use the
special functions of BMDBFCDX as:

BM_Turbo()
BM_DbGetFilterArray() => aFilterRec
BM_DbSetFilterArray( aFilterRec )
BM_DbSetFilterArrayAdd( aFilterRec )
BM_DbSetFilterArrayDel( aFilterRe )

Hi Viktor,

Sorry for misinformation in the previous post, I put a function call
HB_BLATSEND to resolve the problem and continue my testing, and forgot to
remove when you recompile the function. But now that removed the error
persists. The only difference now is that the harbor that automatically
generates the blat.lib and not generated the libpq.lib.
The error below is still, if you have any tips to adjust I appreciate.

***error
hbblat.lib(blatwrp.obj) : error LNK2019: s?mbolo externo "int __cdecl
cSend(char *)" (?cSend@@YAHPAD@Z) sin resolver al que se hace referencia en
la funci?n _HB_FUN_HB_BLATSEND
***

This only applies to text in ChangeLog, and specifically
states that everyone is aquiring this copyright note for
his/her own entries, so I'm not changing terms for anyone
else's work here. If this seems to be a problem I will
modify the text to apply only to my own entries.

I'd appreciate if someone could test this against FSF, but
for me this'd take too much time, so I probably won't be
able to do it.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Leonardo,

Sorry I'm confused about your problem now, is libpq.lib
a problem? isn't it generated, or is it wrongly generated?
If it's not generated probably it cannot find the .dll
in places defined in postinst.bat.

As for blat.lib, I have no idea, here it works with default
setting without any problems.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

Excuse the mess. The problem is with hbblat.lib when compiled with MSVC.
This returns me the error below:

hbblat.lib(blatwrp.obj) : error LNK2019: s?mbolo externo "int __cdecl
cSend(char *)" (?cSend@@YAHPAD@Z) sin resolver al que se hace referencia en
la funci?n _HB_FUN_HB_BLATSEND

Note: When compiled with BCC has no problem.

Leonardo Machado

is a test where use all ADS,DBFCDX,DBFFPT, BMDBFCDX with proper compile script
So i invite made your test for better reproduce your need,
Instead my test will help you  because you if you can't compile your
program you can verify differences  vs  source, script
I not use the any function  that not allow me port on different rdd
and AFAIK this function are used automatically when possible
SET OPTIMIZE ON |OFF over filters In the RDD that admit optimization,
p. ej. BMDBFCDX

Pragmatically speaking they are pretty equivalent (ie. I can use both for my 
FWH applications without noticing any differences in how they work). I'm not 
competent enough to judge the internals, sorry. Harbour seems to be faster 
in simple tests but they are very similar in real world applications.

Hi

>1) Missing codepage handling

I do not have any experience with code pages but 
I can sence y following documentation snippet that it is 
very much possible.


The QTextCodec class provides conversions between text encodings.

Qt uses Unicode to store, draw and manipulate strings. In many situations
you may wish to deal with data that uses a different encoding. For example,
most Japanese documents are still stored in Shift-JIS or ISO 2022-JP, while
Russian users often have their documents in KOI8-R or Windows-1251.

Qt provides a set of QTextCodec classes to help with converting non-Unicode
formats to and from Unicode. You can also create your own codec classes.

The supported encodings are:

Apple Roman
Big5
Big5-HKSCS
CP949
EUC-JP
EUC-KR
GB18030-0
IBM 850
IBM 866
IBM 874
ISO 2022-JP
ISO 8859-1 to 10
ISO 8859-13 to 16
Iscii-Bng, Dev, Gjr, Knd, Mlm, Ori, Pnj, Tlg, and Tml
JIS X 0201
JIS X 0208
KOI8-R
KOI8-U
MuleLao-1
ROMAN8
Shift-JIS
TIS-620
TSCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
UTF-16BE
UTF-16LE
UTF-32
UTF-32BE
UTF-32LE
Windows-1250 to 1258
WINSAMI2
QTextCodecs can be used as follows to convert some locally encoded string to
Unicode. Suppose you have some string encoded in Russian KOI8-R encoding,
and want to convert it to Unicode. The simple way to do it is like this:

 QByteArray encodedString = "...";
 QTextCodec *codec = QTextCodec::codecForName("KOI8-R");
 QString string = codec->toUnicode(encodedString);
After this, string holds the text converted to Unicode. Converting a string
from Unicode to the local encoding is just as easy:

 QString string = "...";
 QTextCodec *codec = QTextCodec::codecForName("KOI8-R");
 QByteArray encodedString = codec->fromUnicode(string);
To read or write files in various encodings, use QTextStream and its
setCodec() function. See the Codecs example for an application of QTextCodec
to file I/O.

Some care must be taken when trying to convert the data in chunks, for
example, when receiving it over a network. In such cases it is possible that
a multi-byte character will be split over two chunks. At best this might
result in the loss of a character and at worst cause the entire conversion
to fail.

The approach to use in these situations is to create a QTextDecoder object
for the codec and use this QTextDecoder for the whole decoding process, as
shown below:

 QTextCodec *codec = QTextCodec::codecForName("Shift-JIS");
 QTextDecoder *decoder = codec->makeDecoder();

 QString string;
 while (new_data_available()) {
     QByteArray chunk = get_new_data();
     string += decoder->toUnicode(chunk);
 }
The QTextDecoder object maintains state between chunks and therefore works
correctly even if a multi-byte character is split between chunks.

Creating Your Own Codec Class

Icons can be stored in a resource file (.qrc):

Example: qapplication.qrc

<!DOCTYPE RCC><RCC version="1.0">
  <qresource>
      <file>images/copy.png</file>
      <file>images/cut.png</file>
      <file>images/new.png</file>
      <file>images/open.png</file>
      <file>images/paste.png</file>
      <file>images/save.png</file>
  </qresource>
  </RCC>

To use the images in resource file:

QIcon(":/images/new.png")

To compile a qrc file:

c:\Qt\2009.02\qt\bin\rcc.exe -name application application.qrc -o 
qrc_application.cpp

.qrc is equivalent to .rc and qrc_*.cpp (can be another name) is 
equivalent to .res.

It will not give any noticeable speed improvement.
Unlike in HVM in RTL there is no code which can well benefit from IPO much.
Probably it will be hard to even measure any speed improvement and it
it's even possible that we would decrease the performance by inlining some
very seldom called functions what will increase the size of whole application
reducing the CPU cache efficiency.

Hi Leonardo,
Yes, thank you. 'extern "C"' was missing from around this declaration,
I'll commit a fix with my next commit.

It is enough that QT is a very important part of your developments.
So we cn hope positively once you will setup the env properly,
GTQTC ++ front is going to be accelerated. Take your own time.

Message-ID: <9257026e0904270723s78c51e29x2e1d0ad7993f3073@mail.gmail.com>

What is the suggested way to get sqlite3 working in Linux?

I've added it to contribs and externals but it seems not enough.
I had to add Linux "detection" in Makefiles.

Is there any other way?

Is it supposed to use the distro version?

best regards,

Probably it would suffice to convert to UTF-8 using our Harbour
APIs from codepage setup by user with HB_GTI_CODEPAGE and feed
these UTF-8 strings to QT API internally. I wouldn't recommend
using QT conversion functions as it would create differences
and confusion when switching GTs.

Sorry, I've never seen a GUI app to lose focus when actively
working with it, just by itself when doing certain internal
window operations, IMO this has to be fixed.

I've checked it, it was <F4> kept pressed. Now I've tried and it
doesn't toggle close button anymore (I don't know why, it just
disables it), but until it did, this effect was very noticeable,
I for example felt back to Far Manager, and it picked <F4> instead
of WVTEXT after a while (can be quite dangerous and unexpected).

Okay.

Hi Marcos,

This is nice, it creates an additionaly layer to deal with
QT resources. What I had in mind is a little bit different;
do you think it's possible to use a QT API to set an icon from
memory, like this:

myicon := hb_memoread( "myicon.png" )
qicon := QIcon( myicon, "mime/png" )

or similar. The idea here is that myicon can be filled
from regular Windows resources, from database, whatever
source and passed that as data to QT.

Brgds,
Viktor

Normally it should be autodetected, if it's not pls tell it's
location, maybe our autodetection needs a tweak.

You can use HB_INC_SQLITE3 envvar to spec header dir manually.

Yes. You don't need to use the external dir version on Linux.

Here's the fix, so you don't have to wait for my commit:

Put line:
HB_EXTERN_BEGIN
before this line:
extern int cSend( char * szCmd );
and put line
HB_EXTERN_END
after it.

Since SQLite is embedded in the app I think it's safe to link the
"external" source so we use a known and ( more ) tested version.

I've added these lines:

ifeq ($(HB_ARCHITECTURE),linux)
HB_WITH_SQLITE3=yes
endif

in external/sqlite3 and these in contrib/hbsqlit3:

ifeq ($(HB_ARCHITECTURE),linux)
HB_INC_SQLITE3 += $(TOP)$(ROOT)external/sqlite3
endif

but probably the planned setup was different.

Lorenzo

It would be something like this?

API_ICON_CREATE( oDlg:hWnd, memoread("M III.png" ) )

HB_FUNC( API_ICON_CREATE )
{
   QMainWindow *pWidget = static_cast<QMainWindow *>(hb_parptr(1));

   if (!pWidget)
      return;

   QImage pImage;
   pImage.loadFromData( (unsigned char *) hb_parc(2), (int)
hb_parclen(2), "PNG" );

   QLabel *pLabel= new QLabel(pWidget);
   pLabel->setPixmap(QPixmap::fromImage(pImage));

   pLabel->adjustSize();
   pLabel->show();
   pWidget->adjustSize();
}

That should do it.

You should try with '=' instead of '+=', otherwise
it will pick the installed version, not the embedded
one.

Not being a hardcore Linuxer I didn't want to make
a decision for this platform, but if Linux users think
it's better to use the embedded one, we can make it.

Brgds,
Viktor

Perfect.

To make this (HB_GTI_ICON or HB_GTI_ICONMEM) more universal,
we should add similar support for GTWVT. [ GTXWC doesn't have
any support for system icon ATM. ] Dunno if this is supported
on Windows, and how, but it'd be useful.

[ ideally we should solve the different formats (ICO/PNG) too. ]

Viktor

Hi Massimo,

Thank you again. I did the tests, but the difference was very small. I got
tested with the RMDBFCDX xharbour.com and yes this was a good difference.
But to me does not pay to buy a license xharbour.com just because of this
option. But if anything like tivese Harbour would be ideal.

Thanks. I've tried it, but loss of focus is still present.
QT not only hides the window, but removes it from the
visible window list (or similar) which makes the next
available app to become active and receive input for
a moment. Quite strange the QT works like this.

I've tried cut & paste and moving the cursor into negative
position (relative to starting position). There is also
much flicker in the selection area. There also a single
pixel of selection if moving the cursor in the same row
as the starting pos.

Cursor invisibility still present when you press F7 and
keep <Down> (or <Up>) pressed, or even <Left>/<Right>
to navigate inside the field.

When you open a new wnd with F10, and navigate the browse
left/right, the last pixel of the vertical lines are
visible on the red (bottommost) line. Probably just a
cycle overrunning by 1.

Brgds,
Viktor

Yes. I am also puzzled why QT removes it from active windows
list.  All the examples in QT documentation only leads to this
method. Don't know how to cover, yet.

Yep. Thi has to be optimized. Will do it in a while.

It is as is.  Even in KDE desktop example cursor is 
implemented like this only. More experiments are needed
to see how it can be improved.

Probably, but I cannot see it on my machine.

Thanks for giving feedback.

  * harbour/contrib/rddads/ads1.c
    ! fixed very bad bug in code compiled for ADS_LIB_VERSION < 600
      in ANSI<->OEM translations - the HVM item value was overloaded
      with translation results
    + added direct support for ADS_TIME, ADS_TIMESTAMP and ADS_MODTIME
      fields and HVM TIMESTAMP values in field get/put operations, seek
      and scopes.
      Warning! Support for timestamp values in VFP tables is limited
      and does not fully respect whole Harbour timestamp arithmetic, f.e.
      timestamp values read from index keys are rounded to whole seconds
      or setting scopes to data values on timestamp indexes does not work
      like in native RDDs or in ADT tables.
      TOVERIFY: please check in which ACE version Ads[SG]etMilliseconds()
                functions were added and if necessary add
                  #if ADS_LIB_VERSION >= ???
                protection. I do not have older ACE headers and I cannot
                make it myself.
      To ADS users: please make some real life tests and report problems
      if any.

Hi Massimo,

It really is very good, and I hope the same that you have an idea of
Przemyslaw.
In this regard I will try to turn me in DBFCDX, and if you need min for
tests or something I am available.

All you have to do is to email it to them and ask them if it will change 
the terms of our license. I believe it does and should not be done until 
the FSF says it's ok. Adding this anywhere in the project might negate 
our GPL protection. That would be bad.

I did some research and considering that ChangeLog counts as
documentation (not code), I've found the following option for
proper copyright protection for these elements of Harbour:

- Creative Commons: cc-by-sa
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses

- FSF GFDL
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License

Both require credits to be given (attribution), cc-by-sa is also
compatible with Debian folks AFAICS.

IMO we should protect *all* our docs with such license, this
includes uppercased files in root and docs/man dirs. I'd prefer
the Creative Commons license as it's much more known than
GFDL, but please comment, I'm not a lawyer.

Brgds,
Viktor

Subject: [Harbour] WCenter() malfunction.
Message-ID: <863216.23913.qm@web28204.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>


Hi,

WCenter() does not seem to work properly, at least in my installation.
The problem arises when I pass the parameter [.t.], in order to obtain a real centering, that is,? in the center of 'physical screen' (or terminal window). Although the wrow() wcol() coordinates seems to been updated? correctly, the window's region does not move to the center of screen. The result is corrupted / mispositioned text, leaking out of the viewable margins of the window.
The interesting thing, which (maybe) could help to isolate the problem, is that if you call alert() and then close it, immediately after the previously unsuccessfully 'centered' window, moves to the correct place in the center and everything looks ok.
The other "collateral damage" is that (portion of) the alert() is not displayed on the topmost screen layer, but overlapped beneath the 'non-centered' window. However, after the "alert() trick"? the overlap problem vanish.

Below is a small prog, showing the problem.
(Tested with both MingW and BCC,? using Pritpal Bedi's latest distro.)

/*----------------------- code -------------------------*/
PROC Main()
SetColor("W+/B")
Scroll(); DevPos(0,0)
? "Hello Harbour.."
? "It was a long time............................."
@ Row()+2, 0 Say? "Ok! now let's open a win. (press a key..)"
Inkey(0)
SetColor("W/BG")
wopen( 0,0,10,40 )
wbox("????????")
WinMess("This is a window. Press a key to center it, please.")
Inkey( 0 )
wcenter(.T.)
Alert(" Hmmm! <wcenter()> doesn't seem to work properly..; ..not to mention that <alert()> is being overlapped!")
winMess("The very same window again. It must be centered now. (or not?)")
Inkey(0)
Alert("How about alert position?")
return

********************
PROC WinMess(cMess)
***
Scroll()
DevPos((MaxRow()/2)-1, 0)
? cMess
RETURN

/*----------------------- End code -------------------------*/

Hi!
Which console GT You prefer for Windows 98 ?
Sample program:
*********************
PROCEDURE main

USE test EXCLUSIVE
FOR x:=1 TO 10000
  DBAPPEND()
  field->abc := x

?
GO TOP
t:=SECONDS()
DO WHILE !EOF()
 x:=RECNO()
 SKIP     //not display
ENDDO
? "time3:",SECONDS()-t
USE
RETURN
***********************

I compile it in Clipper and Harbour, and run on Win98 and WinXP
Result on Windows 98 in seconds:
-Harbour:
--full screen               7.20 ;     2.52 ; 0.00
--full screen + key   237.39 ;  110,18 ; 0.00    
--window               170.70 ;    25.10 ; 0.00        
--window + key        10.82 ;    17,30 ; 0.00
-Clipper
--full screen           10.98 ; 0.06 ; 0.05
--full screen + key  11.04 ; 0.11 ; 0.05
--window                0.17 ; 0.06 ; 0.05
--window + key        0.17 ; 0.11 ; 0.05

On Window XP:
-Harbour
--full screen (key or not)  4.09 ; 0.67 ; 0.00
--window (key or not)      4.94 ; 0.89 ; 0.00
-Clipper
--full screen (key or not)  10.38 ; 0.11 ; 0.00
--window (key or not)       0.16 ; 0.06 ; 0.00

(key - down and hold any key on keyboard)

I usualy use Clipper/Harbour not for dispaly realtime animation :-) .
So, maybe You make GT work like Clipper in window - aplication write to
memory buffer, and extra thread in fixed cycles (200 miliseconds)
display (copy) it to system console.

Win9x console has known bug which cause that program is periodically
frozen for some time period when it tries to execute some console
functions.
The bug is known from Win95 and so far I haven't found any information
that some one resolved the problem. Harbour uses all known workarounds
to reduce the problem except creating separate thread for calling console
functions but there is nothing what can help in keyboard/mouse input and
cursor shape/cursor positioning. In practice it makes GTWIN very unpleasure
to use in Win9x.

The bug effects only Win32 programs not DOS ones.
The separate thread can help a little bit but it will causes
desynchronization between user input and program execution.
just simply it does not eliminate delay so when user press
a key application can receive it a while later. Also bad :-(
Anyhow for some application it will not be big problem.
I wanted to add such separate thread to process keyboard/mouse
input and update the cursor and screen in the past but I do not
have regular windows access and had some more important jobs.
Maybe someone else can help you.

Hello Przemek,

This sample:

[CODE]
#include "hbmemory.ch"

#define CRLF chr(13) + chr(10)

function main

local a , b:= 0

cls

do while .t. 
   b += 1
   dispbegin() 
   VER_MEMO()
   @22 , 01 say b
   dispend() 
   a:={nil} 
   a[1]:=a 
   tecla := inkey()
   if tecla = 27
      exit
   endif
*   hb_gcall()
enddo 

return NIL

*****************
function VER_MEMO
*****************

@11, 01 say "1001 = Memory used (bytes)                        " + str(
memory( HB_MEM_USED        ) )
@12, 01 say "1002 = Maximum memory used (bytes)                " + str(
memory( HB_MEM_USEDMAX     ) )

return NIL
[ENDCODE]

... always return "0", with down:

[SCREEN]
1001 = Memory used (bytes)                                      0
1002 = Maximum memory used (bytes)                         0
[ENCSCREEN]

A few days ago worked perfectly.

Best Regards,

Rossine.

Look at the ChangeLog.
You have to compile Harbour with -DHB_FM_STATISTIC to enable
FM stat module which is now disabled by default.

Thank you very much.
Probably RTE will be better - easier to detect potential problem by
programmer.
If you ask about RTE code then it's a problem. IMHO we should start
to define all RTEs as #define constant and use separate error codes
for different functions/RTEs just like in Clipper.
It means that the whole core code have to be updated.

Here I cannot help you. Sorry but I do not know OLE enough.

As above. Please only remember that our old OLE code comes from xHarbour
were overloading [] in assign operation was not working correctly in the
past so the code may have some workarounds for it. I do not know if it's
fixed in current xHarbour code.

If no one suggests something then IMO you should chose what you are
finding the best and the cleanest solution. I trust your decisions.

As I can see there are two things else which are missing and we should
define if we want to implement them:
1. array support
2. passing parameters by reference
We can also think about introducing yet another feature:
Function which makes explicit conversion from Harbour item given by user
to variant with type also explicitly specified by user. The result should
be returned as GC pointer item and such pointer items should be detected
and supported in OLE function calls. It should help when it's necessary
to pass some strictly defined parameters, f.e.:
   oOle:table( oleVariant( NIL, VT_EMPTY ), ;
               oleVariant( NIL, VT_NULL ), ;
               oleVariant( 123, VT_UI8 ) )
Our default conversion methods does not allow to strictly control variant
types.
But here I also can be wrong and it's possible that in real OLE world
it's not necessary to introduce such functionality so I'm leaving the
decision for you.

Subject: [Harbour] Another Thread - Accessing COM Objects
Message-ID: <23288904.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello All

I am finding it difficult to fire a COM object from
another thread than  the appln's main thread.


   oWord := CreateObject( "Word.Application" )
   if oWord != NIL
     oWord:visible := .T.
   endif

The above code works in main thread but not in 
another thread. I am using hbwin.lib ole protocol.

Any hints, ideas, etc.

Regards
Pritpal Bedi

I think it is much too late to change the license because we will not be 
able to find the original authors on all code. The alternative would be 
to perform a survey and see exactly how much code is involved in that limit.

Having two licenses, one for part of the code and one for another part 
of the code would be a disaster.

Is this all about Attribution? Nothing personal at all here, but Vanity 
is one of the seven deadly sins and leads to many downfalls. I try to 
avoid all 7 of them but at times it's very difficult. We are only human.

If you really feel strongly about this and we gain community support I 
have no problem with relicensing. But it's gotta be all or none.

Hi Phil,

You write about code, while my intent isn't to change any code
license at all. My intent is to *add* license for non-code, particularly
my non-code parts and future additions, these parts didn't have any
license so far. Having two licenses is no problem at all, since code
and non-code (docs/text) are two different things with very different
licensing issues, hence FSF came out with GFDL and that's the whole
point of CC's existence. Code and non-code are very easy to distinguish
by the file type. This new license is endorsed by both FSF and CC,
and even by Debian, or at least the goal is that they be compatible with
all important entities.

Please be more specific what kind of disaster you expect here.

[ Flagging this as "vanity" is yet another interesting attribute I see
here,
and I don't even want to go great length into this, some of us were
contributing for many years, for a huge amount of time and watching names
hidden, yes, it is bothering. For me this is the only kind of reward I may
be
getting for all this, and this doesn't cost money even. I'm just using some
free licenses to protect my works, this is fair and legal, and notice that
I've chosen fairly allowing alternatives to resolve this issue. ]

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Mindaugas,
For me array support is enough to cover passing arrays to
OLE calls and maybe getting back arrays from OLE calls.

Full support in hbwin (xhb) is quite strange, f.e. there is such
code in testole.prg:

[ #xtranslate :<!Method!>( <args,...> ) := => :<Method>( <args> ):Value := ]

#1      oAS:Cells( 3, 1 ) := "Explict DEFAULT Method Text:"
#2      oAS:Cells[ 2, 3 ] += "!"
#3      oAS:Cells( 4, 1 ):Value := "Numeric:"

Three different ways next to each other to express the same thing,
quite unclean. We should probably employ a syntax which works
properly in all situations, whatever that syntax might be. Pbly array
assignment is the one, but I also trust your judgement.

Brgds,
Viktor

Copy source getsys.prg to Your program folder.
Modify it,  do not delete not modifed function from source
(in your copy of getsys.prg must be all function from original).
To Your program add line: SET PROCEDURE TO "getsys.prg"

Hi Pritpal,
I suggest you try with the new implementation in hbole, I doubt
there will be any more updates for the old hbwin one.

Hi,


the following code:
-------------------------------
STATIC snCount := 0

PROC main()
LOCAL nI

   nI := snCount
   snCount := NEWCOUNT()
   FOR nI := nI + 1 TO snCount
     ? nI, snCount
   NEXT
RETURN

FUNC NEWCOUNT()
RETURN 10
-------------------------------

generates output:

The problem is cause by
   nI := nI + 1 => nI += 1
optimization. After converting the expressions we still try to access
original nI expression which does not longer exists.
I'll fix it.

It's access to unused (freed) memory so the bad final results are random.
GPF, infinite loop, etc.
If you are using Linux then recompile Harbour with -g GCC option and
then execute harbour inside valgrind redirecting stderr to file.
You will have quite good bug report for such code.

If you have any other code example which exploits some problems with
current Harbour compiler code then please send them. It will greatly
help to fix the problem.
You can verify them using valgrind. It's not necessary to reproduce
GPF which can be repeatable only randomly.

Yes. I'm looking at include/hbexprb.c function hb_compExprUseAssign code
and harbour.y ForNext symbol code, but could not find the exact problem.
You'll be more fast here.

Thanks, I'll try. Though, it could be caused by this FOR nI := nI + 1 TO
... code also, because it was GPF'ing in the same module.

  * harbour/include/hbexprb.c
    ! modified := optimization to keep alive original LValue name
      used in the assign expression. It fixes FOR / NEXT loops which
      in which such optimized expression were used, f.e.:
         FOR n := n + 1 TO 10; ? n; next
      In fact it's only workaround for potentially bigger problem with
      multiple references to single expression which we probably have to
      resolve if we extend the compiler to not generate PCODE online
      for each compiled statement but only after preprocessing and
      optimizing at least whole function or procedure.

Look at $2 expression in FOR TO / NEXT statement. It was reduced and removed
inside hb_compExprUseAssign() and later reused.
I've just committed the fix though it's rather workaround which simply
keep untouched left side of assign expression and only change/remove
the right side so $2 in FOR TO / NEXT grammar code is left unchanged.

Great! This $2 was my guess! :)

  if( $<asExpr>8 )
  {
     ...
  }
  else
  {
     iSign = 1;
     HB_COMP_EXPR_CLEAR( hb_compExprGenPush(
        hb_compExprNewPreInc( $2, HB_COMP_PARAM ), HB_COMP_PARAM ) );
                              ^^^
  }


BTW, I'm almost sure my previous GPF is caused by the same optimization. 
At GPF I was able to see the last compiled line (hundreds only):
-----------------------------
Compiling 'takas.prg'...
2800
-----------------------------
The exact line of FOR nI := nI + 1 TO ... code is 2848, so, I'm sure 
it's the same bug.

Thank You, for quick fix.

You probably use some older MinGW versions, it would be useful
to know which one. 4.3.x doesn't have this problem. Anyhow I hope
Pritpal can fix this in gtwvg.

I guess your ChangeLog file is edited by some script. Now it is not 
working well after CC license is included into this file.

Is the complete function reads like this ?

HB_FUNC( WVG_SETCURRENTBRUSH )
{
#if ! defined( HB_OS_WIN_CE )
#if (defined(_MSC_VER) && (_MSC_VER <= 1200 || defined(HB_OS_WIN_CE)) ||
defined(__DMC__)) && !defined(HB_ARCH_64BIT)
   SetClassLong( wvg_parhwnd( 1 ), GCL_HBRBACKGROUND, ( DWORD ) hb_parnint(
2 ) );
#else
   SetClassLongPtr( wvg_parhwnd( 1 ), GCLP_HBRBACKGROUND, ( LONG_PTR )
hb_parnint( 2 ) );
#endif
#endif
}

If yes, then probably you have issue with your script. Code compiles 
and works fine on all flavours of MinGW.

Subject: [Harbour] Error compiling with MSVC and BCC
Message-ID: <23306719.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello to all,

I've updated the SVN Harbor, and I am having two problems:

Problem 1 - When using MSVC compile is not generating the LIBPQ.LIB, and I
am setting the environment variables correctly both the HB_BUILD_IMPLIB=yes
as HB_DIR_PGSQL=d:\pgsql

Problem 2 - My application when compiled with MSVC and BCC is not giving
error in compilation, but is not running (opening) and is creating a file
with the descriptions below:

Application Internal Error - D:\SYGECOM\SAGI\SAGI.exe
Terminated at: 2009.04.29 23:03:35
Erro irrecuper?vel 9201: hb_cdxGoHot: multiple marking buffer as hot.
Called from SEGURANCA(2550) in sygecom.prg
Called from MAIN(107) in SAGI.prg
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: I was compiling everything correctly before the last update, my only
problem was with an error in the compilation HBBLAT that now this resolved.

I would also like to make my thanks for the great work of developers and
contributors of the projects are all to be congratulated.

Leonardo Machado

Probably you don't have file D:\pgsql\lib\pgsql.lib present. This is what
Harbour is looking for and this is where this file is when using std
PostgreSQL
binary downloads (8.2.5 - 8.3.3). Maybe you're using older/newer version,
or a different distro. Write some information about your installation and
may
add it to Harbour.

Brgds,
Viktor

Hi Viktor,

My postgresql is installed in D: \ pgsql and am using version 8.2.5. I
believe that the Harbor at the time that this building look for LIBPQ.DLL to
generate the LIBPQ.LIB. And I checked and is in D: \ pgsql \ BIN

But by LIB of PostgreSQL is not my biggest problem. My biggest problem is
that of my application is compiled without error and is not running more,
neither with nor with MSVC and BCC, which does not change any line from when
the error that was reported by the HBBLAT.
In my application still does not use the LIB PGSQL.LIB, he is still doing.
Only reported the problem with the LIB LIBPQ.LIB why I use it in future and
now I'm adapting.

No, for MSVC the supplied lib is simply copied, which should be
where I indicated in prev mail. Only for a few libs there is actual
generation from .dlls in case of MSVC.

If you have something specific pls tell, maybe we can solve it.

Hi Viktor,

If in the case of the MSVC LIB Postgresql is the only copy, then do not
really have the LIB LIBPG.LIB in my installation of PostgreSQL. You just
LIBPQ.A, I am using version NO-INSTALL.

And about the error in my application it gives error on line below:
REPLACE REG1 WITH vATUAL2 

Where this is a simple recording system at the beginning with the date that
the system is open.
The full function is below: 

USE DADOS ALIAS DADOS SHARED
SELE DADOS
IF Rlock()
   REPLACE REG1 WITH vATUAL2  // error
   Dbcommit()
   DBUNLOCK()
ENDIF

And the error that is returning this below in a file with name of
HB_OUT.LOG:

Unrecoverable error 9201: hb_cdxGoHot: multiple marking buffer as hot.

Note: The error occurs with both MSVC 9.0 and 5.5.1 with BCC, the three
lines below is one line of my file .HBP

{win}libs=hwgui hbbmcdx procmisc hbmzip hbziparc hbct hbtip hbwin xhb hbhpdf
libhpdf libpng hbblat blat
{win}gt=gtgui
run=yes

I am using a compiled .BAT with the following line:
hbmk2 -inc -st -trace -oSAGI *.prg SAGI.RC

I guess you are using BMDBFCDX. It's not updated for recent modifications
in core DBF code. Do not use it until it will not be fixed.

Okay so you seem to be using some other distro which provide MinGW libs
only. If you look into postinst.bat you can experiment with .lib generation
from .dll, please try with this line:
         if exist "%HB_DIR_PGSQL%\bin\libpq.dll"           call
:P_MSVC_IMPLIB "%HB_DIR_PGSQL%\libpq.dll"      "%HB_LIB_INSTALL%\libpq.lib"

Brgds,
Viktor

qtwebkit lib with VS 2008. The other ones build fine. Is there any special
trick or can it be downloaded from somewhere?

Hi Przemyslaw,

Ok, it was only to remove BMDBFCDX that solved the problem, thank you for
your attention.

And speaking of BMDBFCDX, there is some planning for the future to optimize
the harbour that neither the type of RMDBFCDX xharbour.com?

Thanks!
Shouldn't we rather always generate hbvmmt, even in DOS, but
on these non-MT platforms hbvmmt be the same as hbvm.
I think we already do this for WinCE platforms. This way no such
platform tricks would be needed at build time.

What do you think?

Brgds,
Viktor

Are you building the libs statically?

If you used shared binaries, there are no problems. QT runs fine.

Static builds are good only if we have commercial license.
Anyway it is heartening to hear that MSVC build static libs execept one.

SET path={drive}:\path\to\qt\lib;%path%

in your batch file and run demoqt.exe and it will execute.

What are the steps to build in static mode with the HB + QT? I had
tried this some time ago but without success, any hint would be
welcome!

Hello,

   
I imported the lib qt????.lib from qt????.dll using "script 
postinst.bat" to compile with MSVC2008.
 
I have SED.EXE for Windows.  
---------------------------
   echo /[ \t]*ordinal hint/,/^^[ \t]*Summary/{> _hbtemp.sed
   echo  /^^[ \t]\+[0-9]\+/{>> _hbtemp.sed
   echo    s/^^[ \t]\+[0-9]\+[ \t]\+[0-9A-Fa-f]\+[ \t]\+[0-9A-Fa-f]\+[ 
\t]\+\(.*\)/\1/p>> _hbtemp.sed
   echo  }>> _hbtemp.sed
   echo }>> _hbtemp.sed
   dumpbin /exports "%1" > _dump.tmp
   echo LIBRARY "%1" > _temp.def
   echo EXPORTS >> _temp.def
   sed -nf _hbtemp.sed < _dump.tmp >> _temp.def
   lib /machine:x86 /def:_temp.def /out:"%2"
   del _dump.tmp
   del _temp.def
   del _hbtemp.sed
---------------------------------
  
The make_gnu creates the libs, but generates errors when compiling:
Generating Code...

I'm using Vista, Harbour SVN, MSVC 2008.
