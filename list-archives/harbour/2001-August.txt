So you can make an rsync server available if required?

The former or the latter? Form your other comments I'm guessing the latter?
Sounds good to me. Patrick?

I'm wondering where we'd CVS it on SF. Creating a new project just to handle
the content of a web site seems a little over the top. Thoughts?

Sorry, that was misleading wasn't it? No, I mean the GT library for Clipper
(as in the Clipper programming echo on the GT Power BBS network). Parts of
that library have been ported to harbour (contrib/libgt) but not all of it.
You'll find the whole library on The Oasis <URL:http://www.the-oasis.net/>.

Get the source and look at BITFLAGS.C. It might not be useful but it sounds
close to what you were after.

Yes I am, as I also have some currious line number appearing on 
the error reported when an error appear from some method. I'm 
currently looking at this error (my case) while _figthing_ with my 
super message and the scoping. If they appear to be linked and 
_if_ I find a solution, the two problems could be solved in one 
shot...

Yes.

But the OOP stuff matters to me more. :-)  And NTX.  And no doubt more
things.

BTW, My experience of procline() is that it's "near enough" most of
the time.

Hi John,

Are you really back ? Do you had a good hollyday ?

As you certainly seen, Ron added some new Pcode, not to speak 
about the fact it was or not necessary nor to the fact the Macro 
evaluation are a bit more different than with clipper, I can't anymore 
compile your sample nor my code because I miss some Prg files 
who need to be recompiled. 

So could you please send me all needed libs ( each one containing 
at least one prg. :-( ) ASAP ?

About the tooltips problem ;

I have reproduced the problem on a small (terminal) program so I 
can work on it even without your new libs.

The problem occur when some method are calling some code like ; 

Super:Create( ::Nx )

There The mechanism used to SuperCast the message Create 
also modify the self reference on the stack later, when workink on 
Create parameters, The OO system think we called Super:Nx wich 
does'nt exist ... I already have a solution here but it broked the 
scoping so as soon as I have a functional solution I will publich it.

In the meantime, you should avoid sending Self:Var as paramater 
to any Super:MethodName( ...) 


See you,

Just as small an answer, not true.

Macro support for list, doesn't "break" __dbList() or anything else, anymore
then extended macro support already "broke" __dbList(), and all other
functions and expressions where macro can be used.

It should at the very least be a separate module in CVS, so that those
of us who only want to get code, won't get the web pages also. Given
that the Harbour source code is checked out using "cvs checkout
harbour", perhaps the web site could be set up so that it gets checked
out using "cvs checkout website".

Good point, I'd forgotten about that option. Sounds spot on to me.

I am not totally opposed to putting CVS on TAZ2, but I'll have to do 
some more research and talk to some of the security guys I know.

TAZ2 doesn't have a firewall running, it's a bastion instead. This 
limits my choices sometimes.

Message-ID: <8593875736.20010801205959@abacuslaw.com>

   OrdSetFocus("MyTag   ") failed on space-padded strings, so I
   had to trim it.
   Rather than burden all rdds with the trimming code, I did it
   locally in ads1.c.  The first idea was to just slam a NULL into the existing
   string at the first space, but it's a pointer to a parameter and that didn't
   seem safe, so I had to copy it.
   Does anyone see a more efficient way to do this?
   Should we move it to ordSetFocus in dbcmd.c?


   UNSIGNED8 pucTagName[ADS_MAX_TAG_NAME + 1];
   UNSIGNED8 * p;
   int i = 0;
   /* ADS can't handle a space-padded string--we have to trim it */
   p = (UNSIGNED8*) hb_itemGetCPtr( pOrderInfo->itmOrder );

   while ( i <= ADS_MAX_TAG_NAME && *p)
   {
      if ( *(p+i) == ' ')
      {
         pucTagName[i] = '\0';
         break;
      }
      else
         pucTagName[i] = *(p+i);
      i++;

Shouldn't "Im a tag   " be a valid tag which at best should become "Im a
tag"? And shouldn't anything to do with file names be submitted to a
function, say HB_FileNameNormalise() so that these kind of issues can be
dealt with in platform independent manner (back slashes -> forward slashes,
finding bad characters etc).

Welcome back. :-)

It's much easier to add them at the end, but in some cases that would be
wrong, due to grouping considerations.

Talking of which, the comments for HB_P_MACROLIST and HB_P_MACROLISTEND in
hbpcode.h don't look right.

Copy and paste error?

The big problem with the code that you posted is that it does NOT trim
the string, but merely truncates it at the first space.

Aside from that, I don't see any problem with trimming the string in
ORDSETFOCUS.

I suppose you *could* consider "trimming" at the C level as having a
buffer of a particular size (meaning size+ 1 for the NULL), but I
don't think any of the harbour code I've reviewed tries to do that.
You would have to find the first space, if any, then dynamically
allocate exactly that much memory, strcpy to it, and release it.
I haven't seen that done (but I can't say I've read every line of
code, either ;-).
If it has to have a NULL anyway, why is buffer size an issue, with a
bigger one being a "big problem"?  Am I missing something?

 OK.

That's not what I'm referring to. What I'm referring to is that your
code truncates at the first space in the string, instead of truncating
at the first trailing space. In other words, your code will convert "A
TAG   " to "A", but it needs to convert it to "A TAG". You need to
change the code to start the search at the tail end of the string,
replacing all spaces with null characters until you find a non-space or
reach the start of the string.

 Thanks for clarifying! Though I doubt tags are allowed to have
 internal spaces and it would have worked by luck,
 I should have done it as you suggest and will change it.

Shouldn't that be:

    while ( p[i] && i <= ADS_MAX_TAG_NAME )

Otherwise you keep checking the 1st char of p.

Just for readability and consitency I would use:

       if( p[i] == ' ' )

Ola, meu nome é Alessandro e estou precisando de um
help

Pesquisando formas de migrar o sistema que utilizamos
(clipper 5.2e) para a plataforma linux, descobri duas
linguagens de programação de peso, o FlagShip e o
Harbour Project.
 
Então comecei a realizar alguns testes de migração
utilizando o FlagShip, porém ele utiliza o .idx que
suporta no máximo 15 índices por dbf e nosso sistema
utiliza a lib dbfcdx do clipper usando mais de 40
índices por dbf.

Gostaria de saber se o Harbour Project é
100%compatível com a lib DBFCDX, caso a resposta seja
negativa, qual uma alternativa viável sem ter que
refazer todo o código fonte.
 
 
Desde já agradeço

  Of course, I was originally "walking a pointer", then switched to

Why do you suspect that your harbour program is causing this? Doesn't the
web server in question keep logs? Don't those logs show why the service
stopped?

You can use the htmllib library to create cgi apps that works with iis.

   * source/rtl/profiler.prg
     + Added HB_Profile::ignoreSymbol().
     * Changed HB_Profile::gather() to use HB_Profile::ignoreSymbol() to
       decide if a symbol should be ignored. This will let developers
       modify what is and isn't ignored by subclassing HB_Profile and
       implementing their own version of HB_Profile::ignoreSymbol().

I see two problems with this new version: The user may be relying on
the length of the tag name not changing unexpectedly and because the
string might be a constant (e.g., ORDSETFOCUS("TAGNAME "), this could
mess up future constant string optimizations. So you should copy first,
then trim. And you should use the ANSI C standard strncpy() function
instead of the for loop.

  This is the main reason this code exists. It would have been much
  easier to just alter the original string (as I indicated in my first
  msg, that would have removed the need for a copy altogether).
  I think you misunderstood what hb_strRTrimLen() does--it
  looks at the string and determines the correct length without
  trailing spaces, but does *not* alter the string.
  This simply allows the copy operation to know the correct length to
  copy.

DGH> And you should use the ANSI C standard strncpy() function
DGH> instead of the for loop.
  I had considered this, and would be happy to change it. But I found
  several places in the Harbour code where these kinds of small string
  copies were done byte-by-byte.  Is there a practical or
  philosophical reason why strncpy is better?

  Thanks!

On platforms that have optimized string manipulation CPU opcodes,
strncpy can be considerably faster than copying byte by byte. Functions
that can provide optimization, such as strcpy, strncpy, or memcpy are
always preferable to byte-by-byte copies, with few exceptions. (One such
exception is a loop that copies while determining where to stop, based
on the contents of what is being copied.)

My question is not something like "how can I use Harbour ?", in place of

Because Harbour is still Alpha, and have some problems as in example,
memory blocks not released, or errors in DBFCDX
And this occur mainly in the times when we do tests with my Harbour CGI

"Mainly"? This suggests that you sometimes experience the problem when
you're not running a harbour compiled cgi. Is that the case?

Perhaps you could write a guardian angel client to keep track of this? Have
it hit port 80 every few seconds and see if you get a response. If you don't
assume that the server has died and log the time. Compare the time with the
server's logs to see what requests were serviced prior to server death.

Hi,

I read this on the Clipper NG:

"Is there plans for NET support for Harbour so that Harbour is a CLR
compliant languages and by using the Visual Studio NET you have a ready
to run GUi development environment for Harbour."

He is right. If Harbour is CLR Complaint, suddenly we have a full blow
GUI IDE Develop envoirement. Not? ;-)

That rather depends on what is meant by a "full blown IDE development
environment". What constitutes one of them?

Yes, but this is what I got:

----
Harbour Compiler 0.37a (Build 37) (2001.06.29) (Flex)
Copyright 1999-2001, http://www.harbour-project.org/
Compiling 'source\rdd\dblist.prg'...
100
source\rdd\dblist.prg(195) Error F0051  Inline C requires C output
generation, use -gc[n]
----

To fix this I can use temporal var to store the value of
hb_comp_iLanguage, so inline checks will pass, and later restore it's
value on finishing:

int iOldOutput = hb_comp_iLanguage;
hb_comp_iLanguage = LANG_C;
...
hb_comp_iLanguage = iOldOutput;

I don't know if this is a good "fix" (it seems a "hack" to me) or if it
will be thread safe.

Yes, better fix is to add support for hb_comp_iLanguage == LANG_OBJ_MODULE.

What effect exactly does -kc have? I can't find any trace of a logic
attempting to use this setting where one would expect (extended support in
macro). I got no errors compiling and running macros with Harbour extensions
(like ++, -=, etc., which generate errors in Clipper) while using -kc.

Did you test your change with -kx and __dbList()? It seems to now break
with:

   Error BASE/1004 No exported method: EVAL

This apparently resulting from the failure of:

   IF( HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_XBASE ) )

On line 79 of source/rdd/dblist.prg

Finally, why would you default to -kh and not -kc or -kx?

Yes, "mainly" suggest it, but that still is not proved, because we are in
different locations and do tests in differents times. At last, we compare
that in times when Harbour program run, IIS is often stopped, not allways,
just in random times
We are trying to isolate to problem, and in that stage is valid "mainly"
because so seem

As stated earlier, we are trying to isolate with different actions, in
order to define "only with" or "inclusive with" Harbour program

We found some Microsoft documents which talks about "IIS and FTP stopped"
with certains DLL, so maybe Harbour is off the problem

Anyway, I send the request to Harbour people because someone could have
something like this. We know that at last the raise of errors depend so
much of the environment of the processes and their concurrence

Subject: [Harbour] New memvar function is needed( Ryszard )
Message-ID: <17911238401.20010805133519@belacy.belgorod.su>

 Ryszard,
  what about adding a function to memvars.c, which will return pointer to the
  memvar item, something like:

PHB_ITEM GetVarAddress( char *szName )
{
   PHB_DYNS pDyn;

   if( ( pDyn = hb_dynsymFind( szName ) ) != NULL && pDyn->hmemvar )
      return  &s_globalTable[ pDyn->hMemvar ].item;
   else
      return NULL;
}  

I want to get addresses of few Harbour level variables in C module at
the beginning of the program for following using, to avoid
calling of hb_dynsymFind() every time when this variable is
needed.
Is this address the same all the time the variable exists ?

Best regards,
 Alexander

  No, because the memory block where memvar items are stored can be 
reallocated to store more memvars. You should store the memvar handle 
instead. This means that at least two functions should be added:

HB_HANDLE hb_memvarGetVarHandle( char *szName )
{
   PHB_DYNS pDyn;

   if( ( pDyn = hb_dynsymFind( szName ) ) != NULL )
      return  pDyn->hMemvar;
   else
      return 0; /* invalid handle */
}  

PHB_ITEM hb_memvarGetValueByHandle( HB_HANDLE hMemvar )
{
   if( hMemvar && hMemvar < s_globalTableSize )
      return  &s_globalTable[ hMemvar ].item;
   else
      return NULL;
}

During some changes in version 1.5 of the file, '-' was globaly
replaced with '='. This suppose to affect only separator lines
but unfortunately also changed FIELD-> references into FIELD=>
options '-v' into '=v' and Hyphan into Equal signs.

Would someone that know the original meaning be kind enough to
fix it ? I'll do it next week if I'll have the time.

  All -k<option> switches control the harbour compiler behaviour. They 
have no influence on the macro compiler that have separate set of runtime 
options controlled with HB_SETMACRO().

  Yes, I have tested it. You have to use -kx during compilation and you 
have to call HB_SETMACRO(HB_SM_XBASE, .T.) in your code to get support 
for macro list (not only in __dblist).

>This apparently resulting from the failure of:

Currently the only difference between -kc and -kh is compilation of 
logical expressions in a codeblock. For example:
EVAL( {|| 1 .AND. someVar, 3} )
will generate a runtime error if -kc is used. If -kh is used then the 
code is optimized to: 
EVAL( {|| 1, someVar, 3} )

  Later I plan to disable support for strong typing if -kc is used - 
however this is not an importand issue now.

  We added many HB_* functions and we fixed many Clipper bugs (it will be 
difficult or even not possible to get 100% Clipper compatibility here).

Then it is obvious that -kh can be the default setting.

Strong typing is already disabled unless -w3 is used. It is a warning level
issue, so please don't make such change.

No it isn't.

All of this change was nothing more then disabling my macro extensions,
while retaining your Clipper incompatible extensions. It's further
compounded with your statement regarding strong typing. I will re-enable my
code, which you had no authorization to disable, on my next session.

What's the logic in doing something like this?

Obviously the compiler will *not* support/generate inline code, *unless* the
source code *contains* inline c, and the output generation requested
supports c output.

Forcing the user to use such switch, when there is no logic involved, unless
specifically requested by means of the code, is plain silly.

I will re-enable my code which again you were not authorized to disable, on
my next session.

  Do whatever you want.

  But please keep in mind:

Your code is not disabled - some features are disabled by default and 
there is an easy method to enable them with a single function call.

The strong typing is still not working correctly (for example, compile 
testwarn.prg => segmentation fault, compile treport.prg - many incorrect 
warnings). The command line switches are disabling/enabling warnings only 
- some reserved keywords are still used for strong typing with no method 
to use them in other context (only HB_INLINE is now disabled by default).

Features available with -kh and HB_SM_HARBOUR set to TRUE are *safe* 
features. This means that the valid Clipper code is still valid in 
Harbour. The macro compiler is extended only to support features that 
available in the normal code.

__dblist(), -kx and HB_SM_XBASE set to TRUE are causing that valid 
Clipper code will produce different results (see DBSEEK() example) - 
there will be needed changes in the code to get the same results. Support 
for macro as a standalone command and macro list expanding can cause 
problems simmilar to RETURN++ issues we were disscusing already. Thus the 
need to disable such features by default.

  Please do whatever you like but please, at least document all 
incompatibilites caused by your code and please follow -k<enable_option> 
functionality.

To clarify, this change has *no* effect what's so ever, on prgs that are
*not* using inline c, and only offers adverse effect on prgs that do use
inline c. So why oh why?

Isn't this making things a bit complicated...
We need to recompile Harbour.exe to use Inline C code??

I can imagine that it is not gonna be simple to distribute a Harbour
build with a 3rd party lib like FiveWin. What Harbour.exe are they gonna
deliver?

Isn't it better to first consult the group before making such great
changes?

Depends who I play with.

If you suggest that you will attempt to revert my change, re-enabling the
code which you were not authorized to disable, you will be doing the exact
same thing that Antonio did, and you yourself labeled as wrong.

I hope you'll not subject this group to this kind of episode again.

Not true! None of the logic for strong typing is used, unless -w3 or -w4 is
used.

Which reserved keywords? Do you have any example to demonstrate the problem?
Only HB_INLINE? You didn't disable my arguments list support, in both
Harbour and macro compiler? What else?

Smoke & mirrors again?

   What is unsafe exactly in inline c?
   What is unsafe exactly in arguments list macro, as array index?
   What is unsafe exactly in arguments list macro, as function parameters?

Do you suggest that arguments list as function parameters, or array indexes,
etc. are not supported in normal code?

Nonsense! The extended macro support is causing factors more of
"incompatibilities", which no one complained about. See my -= vs. == sample.

Right after you point me to the file documenting the "incompatibilities"
caused by extended macro support.

Maybe this it's not related to your problem but could help you.

I had an ASP application in WinNT 4 SP3 running fine.
I upgrade the server to Win2K (IIS5) and after that I had some troubles.

The service was running ok for 2 or 3 hours and after that IIS stopped
responding requests to any .asp page (even simple ones made for testing),
but it served the .html pages.
The server logs didn't show any errors by the time of the problem, but it
reported a few errors previously with no description.
The error number did not appeared in the docs or in MS Website.
I applied patchs, the SP1 but with no luck.

I know that this does not help you but you know you are not the only with
IIS troubles. As it says: "Mal de muchos, consuelo de tontos". :-)

The solution that worked for me was switching into apache for Win32.
Now my app runs even faster!

Horacio

  No. HB_INLINE is compiled in harbour.exe always. However if -ki switch 
is not used then HB_INLINE is treated as usual identifier so it can be 
used as a variable or function name. If -ki switch is passed in a command 
line then HB_INLINE is treated as C inline.

  Sorry, I have started to use Ron's technique - first place a code and 
next defence it. 
  Please notice that no code was removed from the cvs repository. Only 
new command line switches were added to keep more control over available 
compilation options and to give the harbour user a control over Clipper 
incompatibilities.

Linux/gcc
gdb shows the source in some gclib function and is unable to show the 
backtrack info.

  Please try to compile:
_hb_member := 1
_hb_class := 1

  Arguments list support is enabled if -kx option is used or HB_SM_XBASE 
is set to .T. (unless I have missed this one but I have just checked and 
if( HB_XBASE_SUPPORT ) is placed correctly in code).
  Only HB_INLINE is enabled/disabled because it was very easy. Support 
for strong type is burried in many placed - the biggest problem is code 
burried in hbclass.ch thus I have delayed it for much later.

  Again. Valid Clipper code is compiled correctly and behave the same 
both in Clipper and Harbour. -= and ++ operators are not valid in Clipper.

cMacro := "field1,field2"
LIST &macro

is valid in Clipper and is valid in Harbour. However if xbase 
compatibility is enabled then this will produce different results. The 
same is true for macro used as an function argument and array index. 

> Right after you point me to the file documenting the "incompatibilities"

  See doc/en/compiler.txt and a new file doc/en/macro.txt or maybe we 
should create a separate file for this purpose.

All tokens starting with _ are reserved by convention! Further all tokens
with the HB_ prefix are even more so reserved! Why would you make such
obvious dishonest claim?

We should default to either -kc or -kxi (if -ki is needed at all). Either we
are strictly Clipper compatible by default, or we use Harbour extensions by
default. Activating only extensions you developed have no basis in logic.

speculations:

What is unsafe with inline c, that required you to disable it by default?

What is unsafe with arguments list macro as array index, that required you
to disable it by default?

What is unsafe with arguments list macro as function parameters, that
required you to disable it by default?

Please explain why should we support:

    cMacro := "SomeFun( Param1, Param2, ParamN )"
    ? &cMacro

and:

    cMacro := "Param1"
    ? SomeFun( &cMacro )

But not

    cMacro := "Param1, Param2, ParamN"
    ? SomeFun( &cMacro )

Or why should we support:

    cMacro := "SomeArray[ Index1, Index2, IndexN ]"
    ? &cMacro

and:

    cMacro := "Index1"
    ? SomeArray[ &cMacro ]

But not:

    cMacro := "Index1, Index2, IndexN"
    ? SomeArray[ &cMacro ]

???

Just like arguments list macros are invalid in Clipper and produce an error
in 99% of cases.

You know very well that your sample is a *side* *effect* of an
*undocumented* Clipper behavior. This only *happens* to work in Clipper, and
would be better described as a BUG. It is a bug, because it uses an
expression without producing it's value. Any attempt to use such list in
Clipper strictly contradicts the Clipper macro documentation:

     -  Lists as arguments of commands:  The macro operator (&) will
        not fully substitute or compile a list as an argument of most
        commands.  In particular, these are commands where an argument list
        is preprocessed into an array or a code block.  Instances of this
are
        arguments of the FIELDS clause and SET INDEX.  An exception is the
        SET COLOR command which preprocesses the list of colors into a
single
        character string and passes it to the SETCOLOR() function.

You have already documented the arguments list macro an Harbour extension,
what would you like me to add?

IMO that is a problem waiting to surface.  It can have 2 meanings:
a func called with 3 params or (my choice) a func with one param, in
this case a comma-expression.

Sticking to what Clipper does may be best. :-)

I suggest the Clipper behaviour be the default.  I don't personally
even see any point in having the non-Clipper behaviour.

How could the above be seen as a function call with one parameter? I can't
see a comma-expression in the above. For this to be the case wouldn't the
above had to be either this:

,----
| cMacro := "( Param1, Param2, ParamN )"
| ? SomeFun( &cMacro )
`----

or this:

,----
| cMacro := "Param1, Param2, ParamN"
| ? SomeFun( ( &cMacro ) )
`----

Or did you mean something else by "comma-expression"?

I think gtcgi is supposed to serve that purpose:

Message-ID: <3B6EA150.19918.1056BFB@localhost>

Yes, I need help again :-((

Remember, the problem where ::Super:Create(::nX) was causing 
::Nx to be seen as ::Super:Nx :-(( (Full story on the mail history :-) )

My solution seemed simple

1) I create a New array of 1 elem. within hb_msgSuper() in 
classes.c 
2) I assign it the correct value to is uiClass and uiPrevClass 
BaseArray member to fool Harbour it's an object
3) I put the self object to it's 1st elem. to keep it as I will need it 
soon.
4) Treatment ...
When reaching Vmdo or VmSend (hvm.c), I first get the Method 
using the fake object, then I swap (using hb_itemswap() and 
hb_ArrayGetItemPtr() ) the fake object and the real Self on the 
stack and I would like to release the now unneeded array/object...
but any try to do this give me a very nice GPF...
If I don't do it, everythink is working but I get as many unreleased 
block as the Super method is called anywhere at the end of the 
program..

I suspect I use the wrong way to exchange the value on the stack.
Clearly when reaching VmSend and before luanching the pFunc 
(function) pointer I should have changed the current pSelf value on 
the stack and I _must_ release the old one ... I'm in fact not sure 
the exchange worked, this could explain the GPF when releasing it.

PS : I Can't use an hb_itemRelease( hb_itemReturn()) as this 
result in a NIL ITEM on the stack...

Any Idea, welcome ...

  Ron, please think a little.

  With your change you have destroyed a clear separation between compile 
time settings and the runtime settings. 

  Additionally you have killed the possibility to use a single global 
settings during the runtime because call to hb_macroSetMacro() is 
hardcoded in *EVERY* first prg level function/procedure contained in a 
module. It is the worst possible solution - because it will cause a 
random behaviour - the set of available options will depend on the order 
of called functions.
  This also kills the possibility to use settings at the runtime based on 
some configuration files. Now the programmer have to add a call to 
HB_SETMACRO() to every function/procedure to get the same behaviour in a 
whole application.

The GTCGI driver is a minimal streams output driver (the most it ever
does for cursor positioning is advance by one line and then space over
to the correct column position), but it does not support any keyboard
input whatsoever (it returns a CR character every time that Harbour
attempts to poll the keyboard).

Early on, the GTSTD driver attempted to emulate cursor positioning by
using LF and space characters, but all of that was stripped out for
reasons that I no longer remember and a search for "gtcgi or gtstd" in
my message archive subject lines did not uncover. Basically, GTSTD
supports ? (QOUT), ?? (QQOUT), and box/line drawing and supports
untranslated keyboard input via STDIN.

I see nothing wrong with taking the console output routines from GTCGI
and grafting them onto GTSTD.

right.. thinks are becoming clearer :)

Since gtcgi has no keyboard input, I've been working on gtstd here. I've
brought back in the unix OS keyboard support, and the output routines for
the last few revisions, and fixed a bug or two. It's working ok now for
straightforward command-line application stuff.

Do you guys want me to keep going?

For starters, you can submit your changes to a SourceForge developer
who is willing to look your work over and upload it to CVS. For the
GTSTD changes, you can email the finished changes directly to me at
<harbour@spacemoose.com>.

After you've proven yourself (or if another developer vouches for you),
you should sign up at http://www.sourceforge.net/ and then post your
SourceForge ID here along with a request to be added to the Harbour
project as a developer. You will then be able to switch from anonymous
CVS access to developer CVS access and commit your changes directly.

Why would you make it appear so dramatic, when you know, how easy it is to

It can't have 2 meanings, the Clipper language clearly documents the
difference. The proper form of a comma expression is:

   (Param1, Param2, ParamN)

IIRC, Clipper did support it up to S87. When I developed the support, it was
clear to me, that its omission from 5.x was pure "laziness".

Clipper had this support up to S87, most other xBase dialects have this
support. It wasn't your opinion of other Clipper shortcomings as I recall?

See David's response too. Further to my question to him I think I can recall
the reasons why GTSTD does nothing now. IIRC the idea was that GTSTD is a
"do nothing at all" driver so that people can build applications that use
the low level file I/O functions without the GT layer getting involved at
all.

Then you've got the GTCGI driver which attempts to do low level IO via the
GT layer.

That's my recollection anyway:

o GTSTD == Do absolutely nothing, allow programmer to use FWRITE() and the
  like to do output.

o GTCGI == Do minimal low level output via GT. Programmer uses QOUT() and
  friends to do output.

If the code doesn't reflect the above then there's probably some fixing
needs to take place.

Actually, let me have few more moments. I want to add minor extra logic, so
sync is only done once per application for main module only. Since this
takes place before any user code, it's only the default integration. User
can have complete separation if required for some odd reason.

If a PRG includes inline C I'd prefer to get a compile error with the
default compiler settings.  That way new users (and I) won't get
surprised so easily as might otherwise occur.

In general, don't use strncpy for Clipper-compatible strings since
they can contain internal nulls and the copy should not stop at such
a null.  memcpy is what's normally wanted.  It's also easy for a
compiler to optimise. :-)

Common (I hesitate to say "normal") parsing would result in that.  It
looks to be how clipper.exe parses it, if that's relevant. :-)

It's very easy to argue the opposite. :-)

Hmm... it can also have a 3rd meaning: a func with one param, which
when macroed is found to be badly-formed.

I suppose what I really meant was: I don't see how it can be Clipper-
compatible if it's compiled as anything but a func being passed one
param.  Whether that param is allowed with Clipper is another thing.

I would expect those would be calls with one param.  It depends on the
language's semantics/grammar as to whether the case at the top means
the same.

It's not just some odd reason. I might need to mix my modules, that are
compiled one way, with modules from a 3rd party library, that are
compiled another way.

As long as it doesn't change anything so that it's incompatible with current
workings I see no problem.

BTW, I've done a little digging to try and refresh my memory about the
conversation David and I had about the whole "standard" output thing that
lead to some changes being made. It started with a thread on usenet, look at
<URL:http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&safe=off&th=741464abc06a5ca1,10>,
that will give some background.

There was an exchange on the harbour lists too but, looking at the date of
the posts in <URL:news:comp.lang.clipper>, it would appear that this
exchange pre-dates us moving the mailing lists to Phil's box so the exchange
won't be in the archives that Phil has (David, perhaps the dates of the
above Google thread will give you some idea as to where in your archives
you'll find the exchange?).

As you can see from the above URL the problem was that GTSTD was blocking
for keyboard input when none was required. You might want to keep the issues
raised in that thread in mind.

I know how CA-Clipper sees it, perhaps you were on your holiday when Ron and
I had a "discussion" about this exact issue? Take a look at the pointers in
harbour news <URL:http://www.davep.org/harbour/news/#20010718092356>. See

Actually I think it's very hard to argue the opposite. In CA-Clipper terms
what you posted was simply an error. If it's not an error one thing I can't
be is a comma-expression.

That's the CA-Clipper version of events (see above). For it to be a list
expression it would have to be enclosed in parens other than the parens that
form the function call.

The only CA-Clipper compatibility available to us is to throw a runtime
error. If we decide to not throw a runtime error then the next obvious
interpretation is the one that Ron has implemented. Treating it as a list
expression strikes me as the least obvious interpretation available to us.

Anyone can use it in a file amongst many others I may get or be sent
(which includes Harbour itself).  I'd like the default settings for
Harbour to be that it behaves like Clipper so that I get an error if I
compile a file containing inline C, thus warning me of the situation.

I've posted them.

Please let me know where is doc'ed the meaning of SomeFunc( &macro ).

BTW, sometimes the Clipper docs are unclear/wrong and/or they conflict
with what the compiler/runtime do.  Maybe this is a case.

Whether true or not, that doesn't alter that clipper.exe parses
SomeFunc( &macro ) as a function call with one param.

A -kS87 option is fine by me if someone wants to do that. :-)

I think it wasn't "laziness" but rather that Clipper 5, by design, is
more like most compiled languages and less like interpreted ones.

Does your "most" include Xbase++ and VO?  Which _compiled_ Xbase

I'm not sure what your point is.  What does my opinion of some Clipper
shortcomings have to do with the current matter?  AFAIK the current
issue is unrelated.

Would it have to be an odd reason? Suppose I write code that relies on one
way of working, compile it and provide you with a library. Throw in a number
of other such libraries, each author preferring their own switches. You then
want to mix their (binary distributed) libraries with your code. You
wouldn't the code of all those libraries using your switch preference would
you?

Put another way - would it be any less odd to not want the logic
short-cutting of every object (file) in an application be set by the switch
that was used to compile the "main" module of an application?

   So are you trying to tell us that support for list expressions in a 
codeblock is a Clipper bug? For example - what is the difference between:

EVAL( {|| DBSEEK(somewhere),someField} )

and

cMacro:="DBSEEK(somewhere),someField"
EVAL( {|| &cMacro} )

  If Clipper compiles the first then it normal that the second is 
compiled correctly too. And both expressions produce a single value just 
like all expressions in Clipper.

  Ron, this says all. The list of expressions is not supported in macro 
in the meaning as a list of separate expressions. In other words, in 
Clipper:

LIST field1,field2,field3

cannot be substituted with

cmacro:="field1,field2,field3"
LIST &cmacro

because "field1,field2,field3" is interpreted as "(field1,fiel2,field3)" 
wchich gives a single value because it is preprocessed as a list inside a 
codeblock.
  Clipper is clear here. The bug is in your thinking.

  All settings defined in _SET_CH are ignored by the preprocessor because 
_SET_CH is defined by default - it's definition is hardcoded inside a

It looks more like a C++ declaration vs. definition problem, given that
only C++ Harbour builds suffer from it (I tested it with the Borland C++
5.5 compiler with both C_USR and L_USR set to -P and A_USR set to /C).
I've wasted over an hour trying to track it down. Without any luck...

I just finished building Harbour with IBM's C++ for OS/2 and,
interestingly enough, it does *not* suffer from this problem. <shrug>

No, though block lists are inconsistent (elsewhere, list produces all values
unless parenthesized), this is not the side effect I was talking about. I
referred to:

   LIST &cMAcro

It is only incidental that LIST is preprocessed to use codeblocks. If anyone
implements LIST any other way, this wouldn't  have worked. Such side effect
should not be relied upon. The proper way to assure such behavior is to use
parenthesized expression.

I'm glad you noticed that. Now let's ask since it *does* correctly handle
the *list* macro in a code block, why should it fail with this:

cMacro:="DBSEEK(somewhere),someField"
SomeVar := ( &cMacro )

Or even this:

cMacro:="DBSEEK(somewhere),someField"
SomeFun( (&cMacro) )

Is there any reason it will correctly handle list macro (evaluating all
sub-expressions) in codeblock context, but not be able to do same with the
above???

Why shouldn't we consider it a bug?

If you see the point, I hope you'll realize that the list macro without
parenthesis, should also behave exactly as in the non macroed Clipper in all
contexts. Anything short of this must be considered a bug.

Ryszard, this is only because of a serious Clipper implementation problem.
One shouldn't consider this limitation valid, just because the Clipper
implementation of LIST happened to use codeblocks. This is not necessary.
Again just ask your self if list macros *are* valid within codeblocks, why
shouldn't they work in other identical context like ( &cMacro ) and in such
commands?

No it is interpreted as "field1, field2, field3" which *in* *a* *codeblock*
is handled like any other list expression ( evaluate *each* sub expression,
and pop all but the last).

Had the Nantucket guys completed macro support to properly support lists, in
all other contexts, they could/should have used *nonblock* for the macro
expression, and would have had to solve macro lists in high level syntax
like LIST, much like my implementation, and much like you would have done,
if decided to support it.

We didn't have [AFAIK] any of our incompatibilities/enhancements documented.
I just started a new file /doc/en/clipper.txt with the portions I could
fill. There are many many more such items to add, including ones I may be
responsible for.

That's not necessary.

It looks like we're deadlocked.  What happens next - a vote?  Or does
someone implement the behaviour they like and thus more or less force

How is this syncing supposed to work from a Clipper programmer's point of
view? What should I see in my code?

For example, I've got two source files:

,----[ foo.prg ]
| #include "set.ch"
| 
| Function Main()
| 
|    ? HB_SetMacro( HB_SM_HARBOUR )
|    Bar()
|    ? HB_SetMacro( HB_SM_HARBOUR )
|    
| Return( NIL )
`----

and:

,----[ bar.prg ]
| #include "set.ch"
| 
| Function Bar()
| 
|    ? "In Bar ", HB_SetMacro( HB_SM_HARBOUR )
|    
| Return( NIL )
`----

I compile foo has normal (implied -kh, right?) and I compiler bar with
CA-Clipper compatibility turned on (-kc, right?).

Now, if I'm to understanding this "syncing" business HB_SM_HARBOUR should be
true in foo but false in bar, right?

I'm not seeing that when I run the above program:

,----
| .T.
| In Bar  .T.
| .T.
`----

Can someone correct my confusion?

This is not the issue we were debating. We were questioning the possible
ambiguity of the meaning of such expression. Don't you think that macro
expression should behave in the exact same [non ambiguous] way of their non
macroed counterparts?

I'm afraid that the macro inconsistencies, are nothing more then  an

Please explain how is that consistent with the fact that the macro is able
to compile practically any expression other then few odd omissions? Try to
revaluate your statement in light of Clipper "understanding" the same kind
of list macro in a code block context.

Clipper 5 is unlike most compiled languages, in that it offers an [almost]
complete run-time compiler for [just about] any expression that the compiled
language support. In light of what it does do, I consider what it can't
handle a bug. Simple list of such clear omissions include: exp++, --exp, exp
+= exp, (exp), and {|| &NestedBlcokMacro }. But also Var := ( &cListMacro )
etc,.

The "judgment" ;-) that Clipper (consistent, documented, or not) must be the
guide. We should be more open minded to evaluation of bugs, shortcomings,
inconsistencies, etc, not just when it involves an issue pressing on
individual problem. The evaluation process should be as objective as
possible, from a language design, point of view.

  Most reserved keywords don't use the underscore or HB_ refix (NEXT, 
WHILE, etc) but can be used in identifier context (some are less or more 
limited). Also most underscored symbols can be reused by the user. 
  There are three taboo symbols however: _hb_member and _hb_class and 
HB_INLINE - they cannot be reused in a different context.

  Ron, not all programmers live on isolated island. Some of them need 
cooperate in environments where shared resources exist. These shared 
resourses may know nothing about the harbour and may use names that are 
reserved words in harbour. Hence the need to define a minimal set of 
reserved words and the need to allow reuse these words in different 
context.

It is necessary from the standpoint of the documented syntax of expressions.

Well we already have a switch to control this behavior, why would you
suggest forcing?

BTW, in most other aspects of life, those that do put the efforts to make
something happen, end up having more of a say then those less active. This
is just an observation, not related to Harbour in any way.

Message-ID: <006701c11f3d$c68dea60$0205a8c0@apollo>

Been working on the gtstd driver, and loathe as I would be to make changes
to gtapi.c, there does seem to be a problem in the hb_gtWriteCon function.

After calling hb_gtWrite() to output the 'visible' text as it were, it then
makes changes to the row/col position based on control chars parsed earlier,
and informs the gt driver of the new position via hb_gtSetPosContext (line
1059, revision 1.151).

However, it does this with HB_GT_SET_POS_AFTER method, which implies the
positional change has already taken place on the physical device, where in
fact it has not. I believe it should be HB_GT_SET_POS_BEFORE.

This doesn't have any impact on the slang or ncurses drivers anyway, cos
they both ignore the method parameter and alwasy set the pos, but in the
gtstd i'm trying to limit making physical pos changes to BEFORE mode (which
I think is the intention), and it doesn't work unless the above change is
made.

Anyone care to agree/disagree?

Regards

Fergus

Syncing is only provided for the main module, so that any user's explicit
setting will not be overridden. Rather then have completely obscured
default, it simply attempts to offer just a slightly more relevant staring
point.

I still find serious problems with the implementation of HB_SETMACRO() over
all.

I think this management, should be completely automated and compile time
driven. Otherwise, *every* well behave module *anyone* develops, *must*
first save current settings, then set the desired level, and later restore
previous values, for *every* macro activation. This seems redundant, and can
be achieved automatically.

In essence, we could add just 1 more byte after the HB_MACROPUSH* opcodes
which indicate the compile time flag for that module. The HVM processing of
the HB_P_MACROPUSH* will read the byte and set hbmacroSetMacro() with the
appropriate value.

Ryszard?

Ryszard, you know that this can easily be fixed if desired, based on context
(without having to use any compiler limitation switch)!

Ok, I'm just surprised that you appear so sensitive to reservation of odd
tokens like _hb_member, _hb_class, and hb_inline. It is somewhat odd, that
when I developed simple context based logic, to allow de-reservation of some
partially reserved Clipper tokens, you dismissed the need for it, yet these
far less likely to be used tokens, are of more interest to you.

The only thing that HB_GT_SET_POS_BEFORE and HB_GT_SET_POS_AFTER are
telling the hb_gt driver is if this cursor positioning call is taking
place before or after text was written using the hb_gt driver. There is
no implication of whether or not a positional change has taken place,
which is entirely up to the hb_gt driver to determine.

For example, with the hb_gt driver gtwin, writing the text does not
actually change the cursor position, so the gtwin driver must set the
correct cursor position.

But with the hb_gt driver gtpca, the cursor position has changed and
the gtpca driver only needs to record the current cursor position. Which
should also be the case for the gtstd driver (i.e., the cursor needs to
be positioned BEFORE, but not AFTER, because writing text to STDOUT
changes the cursor position).

Most (all?) other extern declarations in harbour are in header files and
they are guarded with the likes of:

,----[ Excerpt from hbvm.h ]
| #if defined(HB_EXTERN_C)
| extern "C" {
| #endif

So.. in that case, the gtwin driver always sets the cursor position
regardless of BEFORE or AFTER..

Yup. I think we're in agreement. So, it would then seem that the gtWriteCon
call should be using BEFORE, as otherwise the change to the current row
(after an LF for example) is only going to be noted by the driver, instead
of executed. Yes/No?

Actually, Clipper 5 isn't at all unique in this regard. Examples of other
languages that are compiled (to byte-code) that are able to evaluate
themselves that spring to mind are perl, python and Common Lisp.

I'm still confused then. Why do we have what seems to be a compile time
setting *and* a run-time setting? Moreover, why do we have one (compile
time) that can override the other (run-time). Or am I missing the point
here?

Perhaps this is the source of my confusion? Personally I'd have thought that
this could only usefully be a compile time option, kind of like how logic
shortcutting works.

Am I missing something obvious here?

This is my thinking too. I'd have thought that this would be best done as a
compile-time switch and only as a compile time switch.

No, because the only purpose for the flag is to communicate if the
cursor positioning call is being made before or after a call that writes
to the screen and in the case of gtWriteCon(), the cursor position is
being set *after* a call to hb_gtWrite(), not before, so the call *must*
use the AFTER flag.

Remember, the BEFORE or AFTER flag is *only* telling the hb_gt driver
*when* the call was made (before or after a write to the screen). It is
*not* telling the hb_gt driver what to do. That is *entirely* up to the
hb_gt driver.

The problem I'm having is when gtWriteCon is called to output a newline. For
example, at the start of a QOUT(). Assume on say row 3, not near maxrow().

gtWriteCon traps the LF char in the string and advances its iRow working
variable (to 4). It doesn't call gtWrite at all. Then it passes the new iRow
value to the driver via SetPos, with AFTER mode. At this point, there has
been no output to the physical display and no cursor movement.

If the driver is able to jump to an absolute cursor position without
reference to the current position, it can disregard BEFORE/AFTER and always
move the cursor - which gtcrs and gtsln seem to do. gtstd doesn't have this
luxury so has to insert spaces/newlines only in BEFORE calls.

If gtWrite is called within gtWriteCon, the gtWrite function itself always
calls SetPosContext using AFTER anyway, so I don't see the imperative for
gtWriteCon to do a second AFTER call.

Could you explain why not?

Here's how I look at it: Macro substitution is, for the most part, a program
text manipulation facility. That CA-Clipper and harbour are byte-code
compilers doesn't really enter into the discussion at this point. So, to
make sense of what "should be", we need to consider what the resulting code
would be if a programmer had written it into their editor. Right?

This:

,----
| Foo( 1, 2, 3 )
`----

is a function being passed three parameters. This:

,----
| Foo( ( 1, 2, 3 ) )
`----

being passed one parameter. Right?

So, viewing macro substitution as just that: macro substitution, logic would
suggest that:

,----
| cParams := "1, 2, 3"
| Foo( &cParams )
`----

is a function being passed three parameters and this:

,----
| cParams := "( 1, 2, 3 )"
| Foo( &cParams )
`----

is a function being passed one parameter.

I'm not sure how we can usefully view it as anything else. I'd hope for a
far more insightful explanation than "That's not necessary" before we see
any talk of "deadlock".

Personally I do have reservations about the idea of extending the macro
compiler in this way (see my previous pointers) but, if we were to extend it
this way, I fail to see how the two examples I give above can be read any
other way.

> It looks like we're deadlocked. What happens next - a vote? Or does

Personally I'd hope to read some more detailed technical reasons and
objections before there's any talk of people forcing things on people.

Again 100% agree. I believe that the Run-Time setting (HB_SETMACRO()) should
be completely dismissed in favor of automatic management driven by compile
time switches.

Of course. This was only in the context of the reply to the specific point

hbmake is your baby so it's your call. If you're concerned that the -go
switch isn't "stable" enough yet, don't be. Even if it isn't "stable" you'll
be doing harbour a service by ensuring that this feature of the compiler
receives more stress testing.

BTW, claiming that co-op programmers, developing shared resources in a PRG
file to be compiled by Harbour, may not know about Harbour to avoid [_]HB_
prefixed symbols, is IMO a stretch. If they indeed existed, they would have
immediately be confronted with the obvious reality, and could/would perform
needed correction, in about the same time it takes you to read this message.

You can add code to your hb_gt driver to track whether or not there has
been a call to hb_gtWrite() in between calls to hb_gtSetPosContext() and
use that information as part of the decision regarding whether or not to
physically adjust the cursor position in addition to recording it.

Because gtWriteCon() isn't called for certain control characters that
change the cursor position and it is possible that the entire string
consists of such characters.

Blast! Yes, I did. Fixed.

Actually, it wasn't "cut & paste", it was `dabbrev-expand' in emacs. T'was
operator error though. Ok, ok, yes, it was an over-engineered lisp powered
"cut & paste" error. ;>

I am, however, highly insulted by the implication that I'm a slow learner.

As I understand your point of view,you are saying if I enable the -go switch
on harbour, this harbour compiler switch will be more tested.

By my small tests, I´ve got about 15 to 20% of speed up on the make process.

Now one more question.

should i create the harbour.cfg file from hbmake if this file don´t exist

My apologies then. It was meant to emphasize the complexity and deep roots

Presumably hbmake will make the use of this switch optional?

How will you know if it doesn't exist? How will you know where to create it?
How will you know what to put in it?

Well not really cross purposes, but I can relate to the confusion. Ryszard
actually added the ability to disable the minimal syncing. This does not
conflict with my code, but rather complement it to a degree. I personally
don't see the need to disable it, which instead simply dictates an obscured
starting value, with complete disregard to any hinted intention.

Should we all agree that independent Run-Time switch is redundant and
confusing, and should we then replace it with the suggested automatic
management, driven by compile time switch, we will likely no longer need the
above.

I can't seem to locate them in the archives which suggests to me that it
isn't just the case that the announcements didn't make it to my box.

Did you guys send announcements for the above? Can anyone see them on the
archives?

Probaly Yes. I´m think to extend the -e Switch.
my options will be.
-e The standart hbmake files(.prg to.c  and then .c to .obj/.o
-eh The special hbmake files (.prg to .obj/.o  by using the harbour -go
switch)
the -el switch im thinking to change to -l. it will create hbmake file like
the -e
and an -lh : same description of -eh.

I´m open for suggestion for this switchs

I´m thinking to check acording to the platform.
On Win32/DOS/Os/2 i´ll look first on the /bin directory of the harbour
instalation. if not found, then i´ll look on the directory listed in the
PATH envar.

Under Linux mode, i´ll thinking to look on the /usr/local/etc

Sugestions are welcome.

Mine, was just a minor typo correction to doc/en/clipper.txt, that I quickly
made during our exchange. I didn't get to post any email or ChangeLog entry.

With your point and with the fact that HB_SM_* constants are Harbour
extension, you should guard them with HB_EXTENSION and move them to
a separate file (somewhere like hbset.h or hbset.ch).

(My issue is about order in code and nothing about the necessity or
functionality of the code itself)

If it were me I'd probably follow the logic in gencobj.c, for example, on
GNU/Linux it currently looks in /etc and /usr/local/etc. Also note that, on
GNU/Linux for example, you won't generally have write permissions to either
of those directories so you wouldn't be able to create the config file.

  Sorry, there was a change of my internet connection administrator (all 
IT stuff was fired) which is now replaced with a new gay. However it 
caused many problems with email acounts - it was not allowing to read 
messages few days ago and it refused to send my emails yesterday. It 
seems that I will have to set my own email server finally.
  I have send it today.

Well, I'd agree in so far as I don't want to change gtapi.c. However,
gtWrite isn't part of the driver so I don't think the driver should be
trying to track its usage. Because of that, I'd have to say it's a bit of a
kludge.

Exactly.. but for these control characters no function in the driver is
called (before the SetPos call) which means no writes to the screen, and to
quote you from an earlier message: "the only purpose for the [iMethod] flag
is to communicate if the cursor positioning call is being made before or
after a call that writes to the screen".

Even if gtWriteCon handles a combination of printable text and
aforementioned control characters, the printable text is still written to
screen first via gtWrite calling hb_gt_Puts and then SetPos with AFTER
method. Any further changes to the cursor position are then communicated to
the driver via a second SetPos call (in gtWriteCon()), before which no
further writes to the screen have taken place.

I note also that none of the drivers except cgi and std make use of the
iMethod flag in their SetPos call.

Hope you don't mind me dragging this out.. although tiresome, I think it's
the correct to tease these points out in the public record of the mailing
list  :)

This was reviewed many months ago, but I hope an silly solution based in
Clipper compatibility

I have many Clipper programs using DBSELECTAR( x ), and compile/link/run in
Clipper without problems

When I try in Harbour,  can not link because " Unresolved external
'_HB_FUN_DBSELECTAR' ", so I must change to DBSELECTAREA( x ) in order to
link. 

There are many programs to change
I think if DBSELECTAR(x) work with Clipper, should work with Harbour
without changes

The same happen with DBCLEARREL

And EVENTMASK is not recognized too

Gracias,

Are you sure or is that a guess/opinion?

BTW, if we make SomeFunc( &cMacro ) with commas in cMacro mean
multiple params, presumably we count extra params for
	SomeFunc( param1, &cMacro, paramN )
and similarly for methods.

Please can we hold off on this until methods (especially super calls)
work properly?  I don't think Jean needs any extra difficulty right
now.

At the moment, SomeFunc( param1 ) creates code like:
	HB_P_PUSHSYMNEAR	SomeFunc
	HB_P_PUSHNIL		// I guess this will vanish in due course?
	HB_P_PUSHLOCALNEAR	param1
	HB_P_FUNCTIONSHORT	1
Where the 1 is the param count.

What do you plan to change this to?  Will it affect all function calls
or just those with a macro?

John.

"Inizio" means "start", a little test of mine took 4.37 seconds to

Esegui() took 7 second and Interprete() 4 seconds!! So profiler thinks
my test took at least 11 seconds!!

Platform: OS/2 EMX GCC.

PS. Number of calls seems to be correct.

I'm not quite sure to be honest. I'm still wondering why a harbour.cfg is
even required if its content can be guessed anyway.

Does the -go switch look for harbour.cfg in the current directory? Perhaps
you could create one there if none exists in the config path?

  I disagree. There is no inconsistency. There is no other context where 
list is used - the list of function's arguments is not comparable case

  This is not incidental but it is very logical choice - only codeblocks 
are able to proccess all valid Clipper expressions - this includes access 
to local and static variables. Implementing it, for example, as a macro 
will not allow for it. 
  The result of all valid Clipper expressions is always a single value. 
This is the proper and expected behaviour. &macro is an expression that 
also should return a single value and it was returning it until you 
decided to change it.

  Because a codeblock is a list of *code* blocks (expressions) - in other 
words it encapsulates the list of expressions. Notice that the value of a 
codeblock is the codeblock itself. It must be evaluated to get ,,access'' 
to the list contained in a codeblock.
  &macro was designed to operate on single expression only (if not used 
in a codeblock). Thus any attempt to process a list of expressions should 
fail.

  I don't see it as an implemetation problem. It is very naturel solution 
to support all valid Clipper expressions, including local and static 
variables. Have you any idea how to give support for locals and statics 
withot using a codeblock?

   We are talking the same here.

  The lists are handled correctly in Clipper except the limitation in a 
support for "(expr1, expr2)" syntax.

  See doc/en/compiler.txt for the list of such incompatibilites that I

  Why you are always trying to complicate a simple things? Please leave 
the separation between the compile time and the runtime settings and 
nothing more is required.
  Compile time settings are set by command line switch and runtime 
settings are set with HB_SETMACRO. Clean and simple.
  Every other solution will make things worse. 

  Not to mention that the compiler switches and hb_setmacro() can/will 
set quite different set of features.

You can track it's usage by tracking the usage of hb_gt_Puts(). And in
hb_gt_Puts() you also need to do physical cursor positioning if the
specified position doesn't match the stored position in the hb_gt driver.

So I left out the word "potentially" (is in "potentially writes to the
screen").

Correct. Think of the BEFORE flag as meaning "Here is where the cursor
needs to be" and the AFTER flag as "Here is where the cursor should be."

I don't mind at all. But I also don't think that there is any need to
change anything in gtapi.

  We were discussing it already. Your solution has added nothing.
RETURN++
syntax can be replaced in flex with RETURN := RETURN +1 that still allows 
for full reuse of this keywords without problems we were discussing last 
year.

  Who said that it must be a cooperation? Think about any commercial 
software that are making available some method call through, for example, 
ActiveX (or any other buzzword technology taht is currently hot).

I have experience with the cooperation with some software company that 
developed a software for some medical instruments. Any attempts to ask 
for changes ends with: it works in other customers instalation than why 
you want to change it? Maybe after the year of email exchanging I would 
receive what I asked but who will wait so long?

  Think about some SQL column named '_hb_member' that is used by many 
applications used on many distributed environments. Do you think that 
such changes are easy or even possible?

  Partially, yes we have not common purposes. 

  What is wrong with leaving the programmer the possibility to change 
some application behaviour at runtime?
  Why the programmer cannot request strict Clipper compatibility during 
compilation and at the same time use extended operators and object 
handling (assignments) during the runtime? 
  Why not use all extended macro capabilities in code where the 
programmer have full control and next use temporarily restricted set of 
macro capabilities when processed data are taken online from the user

  They are some SET alike definitions that I have looked at set.ch first 
without even thinking.
  I have used set.ch because there is no hbset.ch and there are placed 
already some harbour extensions here (_SET_LANGUAGE, _SET_IDLEREPEAT) so 
I assumed that it is OK to place new settings here. Of course they can be

Ryszard, you must know this can't be true, or else, *please* explain the
difference between:

Var := 1, 2, 3
Var := (1, 2, 3)
Var := Eval( {|| 1, 2, 3 }
Var := Eval( {|| (1, 2, 3) }

It is incidental, because it's an undocumented implementation detail. LIST
is the documented command, it's purely incidental that it's implemented by
means of any pre-processing, or __dbList(), etc. One could have implement
native parser support for LIST and still fully support the documented
Clipper LIST syntax, right?

It is also incidental, because *nowhere* [that I could found] is it
documented that Codeblock *does* support macros of lists!!!

Here is Clipper documentation for "{}" (curly brackets):

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax

     { <exp list> }                 (literal array)
     { |<param list>| <exp list> }  (code block definition)

 Operands

     <exp list> is a list of expressions of any type.  If the item is a
     literal array definition, it can contain another literal array
     definition.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, is it not fair to expect that given:

   cExpList := "1, 2, 3"
   bVar := {|| &cExpList }

the following should work too:

   cExpList := "1, 2, 3"
   aVar := { &cExpList }

Or, in the alternate, that given:

   cExpList := "1, 2, 3"
   aVar := { &cExpList }

produces a '&' error, so should:

   cExpList := "1, 2, 3"
   bVar := {|| &cExpList }

???

Please explain how should we resolve Clipper behavior here with the
documentation.

So a Macro *can* or *can't* represent a *list* of expressions in Clipper?

Yes of course. LIST could have been supported directly by the parser, just
as easily.

It's wrong because the price for this, is complete lack of integration. It's
wrong, because it's *more* natural for the user to expect that if he
compiled a prg with -Kc  then the Macro Compiler (used in that same prg)
will conform with the same setting *by* *default*.

If you can provide complete automatic inheritance, and still provide such
freedom, then by all means go for it. Otherwise, offering the correct
default setting, is more important, if both can't be achieved together.

Dave,

look at this:


Name                                Type       Calls    Ticks       Seconds

__MVPRIVATE                         Function      22790          46        0.00
COL                                 Function       9350          45        0.00
LEN                                 Function      12167          20        0.00

I let this program run for 45 seconds. Interprete() is the entry point and, as
you can see it says 44 seconds.
Interprete() calls Esegui() and Esegui() says 85 seconds! So it is plain wrong.
It seems that it adds Interprete()'s time to Esegui() one.

Is this possible?

regards.

The request was for *explanation* of the differences. Obviously I know #1
won't compile yet #2 will compile.

This was in response to Ryszard claiming that there is no inconsistency in
the way codeblocks treat a list of expressions *without* parenthesis the
*same* same as if it *was* parenthesized, *unlike* *every* other context in
Clipper, where such omission yields completely different results.

The problem is not in the counting of ticks, but in the conversion from
ticks to seconds. It's obvious that the conversion factor being used is
divide by 100. Given that your program ran for a total of 15,541 ticks
and you said that it ran for 44 seconds, the value that is being used
for ticks per second with GCC for OS/2 is off by about a factor of 3.5
and should be close to divide by 350.

  And what you are offering instead? Many modules, libraries all compiled 
with different switches. Which module will win? What settings will be 
active in init procedures - what if programmer wants to use a single 
settings for whole application - including init procedures from modules 
from a library where the source is not available?

  In other words: total chaos during initialization and total 
recompilation of all available modules instead a simple change in 
configuration file of running application?

  The lack of integration is a big bonus then.

  How it can be ,,*more* natural'' to expect that two quite different 
subsystems (linked only with the common name) will bahave the same. More 
natural is expecting that they will be not related in any way.

  But ,,complete automatic inheritance'' is the exact opposite (mutually 
exclusive features) of such freedom - then any attempt to achieve it will 
fail. The correct default setting is documented in doc/en/macro.txt - if 
it is not appopriate then it can be changed with a single HB_SETMACRO() 
call.

In the second SetPos call mentioned above, I think it's definitely a case of
"needs to be" and not "should be".

No, it's definitely a case of "should be", because most of the time, a
string actually gets written to the screen.

No, it's there for synchronization purposes. As in, "Here's what I have
the cursor position set to now." It has nothing to do with whether or
not the hb_gt driver should or should not physically move the cursor
position. It's up to the hb_gt driver to determine whether or not it
needs to physically change the cursor position to match. Changing this
one gtapi call to use BEFORE will not in any way help to determine
whether or not the cursor position should be physically moved. It
doesn't matter to the GTSTD driver if the value is BEFORE or AFTER for
this particular call, because it is going to have to track whether or
not anything has been written to the stdout device since the last cursor
positioning attempt and use that in it's determination of whether or not
go physically change the cursor position. But it could matter to other
drivers, which is why it must remain AFTER.

Every module will win! Each module will respect the setting that was

Which module wins when different modules are compiled with/without -Z? ALL!

The setting that was requested when compiling the respective module in which

You mean he should be able to override the setting for a 3rd party LIB? If
this was the case, did you read my message that explained that now *every*
macro activation would *have* to be guarded with a save and later restore of
all the macro flags?

If the source is not available, doesn't it mean the setting the author
specified should be honored?

What are you talking about? What you implemented is what will cause a
complete and total chaos! No one will need to recompile other modules
because one module requires certain setting if my approach is used. Each
compiled module, will encode the required setting for every macro activation
in that module.

No. It's a clear indication for implementation lacking proper planning.

No. They should NOT behave the same! Each will execute in a protected
environment, guaranteeing correct setting for each macro activation within
that specific module.

> More natural is expecting that they will be not related in any way.

Absolutely! But your implementation does not allow for that, *without*
having to *save* *every* macro setting *before* *every* macro activation,
and later *restore* *every* macro setting *after* *each* macro activation.
Or else total chaos will prevail!

Not true. One must have freedom to specify correct setting for *his* module,
without warring about overriding someone else's module requirements. I can
easily implement a solution that will allow everyone the freedom to specify
correct setting for any module in compile time, and for that setting to be
*guaranteed* for every macro activation in that module, without any impact
on any other module!

2 simple solutions:

1. Put the logic with the macro evaluation of user input in separate prg
compiled with the reduced setting.
2. Use #pragam -kc before that code fragment and later #pragme -k* after
that segment.

  Well, Ron I feel a little embarassed to answer this but I will try.

The first is a random collection of numbers written after 20 hours of 
hard work by the programmer who spends too much money on some lottery.

Second is a parenthesized expression valid in Clipper that returns a 
single value.

Third is a codeblock with the list of expressions. The list consists of 
three expressions.

Forth is a codeblock with the list of expressions. There is only a single 
expression on the list.

  Yes, it is undocummented. And it is incidental that this feature is 
used in all commands where FIELDS clause is accepted as it can be seen in 
std.ch. Have you really seen any fully documented software? With all 
details written black on white?

  Ron, all commands are preprocessed in Clipper 5.x by design! This is 
not incidental! Please stop arguing such point of view.

  A codeblock supports a list of expressions.

  See documentation for arrays and codeblocks.

  If used inside a codeblock then - Yes it can be a list of expressions.

  Then how you will pass expressions that are using local and static 
variables? By reference? OK but only if simple variable is used. What if 
complex expression is involved, for example: PADL(someField,nLen) where 
nLen is a local variable. You will have to create .... surprise :) 
some kind of codeblock. Why double efforts if a codeblock already exists?

  Ron, you are arguing to allow macro compilation of "expr1,expr2". Here 
is the example of syntax where there is obvious Clipper limitation that 
is beyond the scope of this debate.

The problem is whenever a string is written to the screen, this is done via
the gtWrite call, which itself calls the SetPos function with AFTER, quite
correctly, and the driver thus notes the new position without physically
doing anything. The row is then changed in gtWriteCon and the driver is
called again using AFTER with the new row value. The driver again notes the
new position and doesn't do anything, but as this point the physical cursor
hasn't moved to the new row, but now both gtapi and the driver think it has.

Anyway, I'm just ignoring AFTER calls from the gtapi and doing the tracking
internally, which is pretty much what the gtstd driver has been doing all
along. All the same, it's a bit wasteful to have gtWriteCon in gtapi parse
through the string to calc the new cursor position, and then have gtstd
repeat the same process in its AdjustPos function.

In any case, it's working with the gtapi as it is. I'll forward the source
shortly.

Regards
Fergus

I can understand your embarrassment. Clipper has a documented and
consistent(?) support for lists of expressions. In all cases *except* code
blocks, lists are interpreted as multiple arguments. You *must* group all
lists of expressions within parenthesis in order to produce a *single*
value, *except* within codeblocks. I believe most logical persons equate an
exception with inconsistency.

I'm confident that you know the difference between implementation detail,
and design specification.

Ryszard, this is an implementation detail, not a design
specification/requirement.

This does not address the fact that macros of lists are generally *not*
supported, and that there is *no* documentation that macro of lists *are*
supported in codeblocks, but *not* in any other context, and maybe even
specify why!

But the macro is not different, is it? Please tell us why should the first
be supported, but not the second?

In Clipper documentation both expressions specified as macro above, are of
the exact same kind.

Why the *if*? What is the logic supporting such arbitrary logic? Do you

It would not require any use of references, a simple PUSH would be generated
within a loop in the scope of the *current* function.

Not at all, it just corroborates the fact, that the macro compiler has many
obvious bugs. How else would you explain lack of support for simple
expressions like Var++? It simply never received the full attention, what
would expect.

Actually worse, I forgot the required setting phase. So every macro
activation will have to look like this:

aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_HARBOUR ]   := HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_HARBOUR )
aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_XBASE   ]   := HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_XBASE )
aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_SHORTCUTS ] := HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_SHORTCUTS )
aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_PREPROC ]   := HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_PREPROC )

HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_HARBOUR, * )
HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_XBASE, * )
HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_SHORTCUTS, * )
HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_PREPROC, * )

&someMacro()

HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_HARBOUR,   aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_HARBOUR ] )
HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_XBASE,     aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_XBASE   ] )
HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_SHORTCUTS, aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_SHORTCUTS ] )
HB_SETMACRO( HB_SM_PREPROC,   aMacroFlag[ HB_MACRO_PREPROC ] )

Or maybe:

aMacroFlags := SaveMacroSettings()
&someMacro()
RestoreMacroSettings( aMacroFlags )

With appropriate logic in Save/RestoreMacroSettings()

  -Z switch controls generation of pcode during compilation. Thus it 
cannot be changed at runtime.

  I see the need to control macro compiler capabilities at runtime. 

  You don't see such need. 

Current code allows to control it regardless if you like it or not. 
Adding additional pcode to store compile time settings will kill the 
ability to change it at runtime. 

  Please, again, do whatever you want, I have better things to do. But 
any attempt to kill possibility to set capabilities at runtime will be 
disabled (#ifdef'ed) in some form by me as long as I will work here.

I thought the whole point of the compiler switch was that no module would
"win" but that each module would work depending on how it had been compiled.
Exactly like the logic shortcutting switch works. I think it's safe to say
that as long as a switch exists to control macro expansion compatibility
most people would expect it to work like that.

It's not control at runtime that bothers me, not in itself. It's this
mixture of compile time and runtime control. If I'm to understand the issue
it's about control of how macro expansion works and how compatible it is
with CA-Clipper. Right?

My concern here is that you might be using some code that I've written and
I've only supplied you with a binary (object) of that code. My code relies
on the macro compiler working in a specific way.

Now, you decide, at runtime, to set macro expansion compatibility to a value
that's different from my code. This might well have unexpected consequences
for the execution of my code and also for your code.

As I'm looking at harbour right now, and I could be wrong here - this is the
clarification I'm seeking of yourself and Ron, it would appear that I can
control how macro expansion works by using a compiler switch. That's fine -
I compile my code using the macro expansion compatibility level it needs and
I hand the object file over to you (probably as part of a library).

But, as I see it, it appears you can change this at runtime (see above).

The alternative is to control it all at runtime, in which case why the
compiler switch?

I'm afraid I don't follow this at all. Could you give a clear example? Why
would someone want to compile a PRG file with macro expansion compatibility
set one way yet change it, in the same PRG, to something else at runtime?

Ok, I think I see what you're driving at here. I can see some use for this,
I'd have expected this, however, to either be controlled only by the
compiler or only at runtime, not a mixture. If people want different parts
of their code to use different compiler settings can't it be done with a
#pragma or something (like you can with Borland's Pascal compilers)?

To see the confusion I'm experiencing, the position I'm trying to clarify,
look at the problems I had while playing with this "sync" business. I'm
currently failing to figure out how all of this is supposed to work. Perhaps
yourself and Ron could document what should and shouldn't happen?

David,

I wrote this small sample:

proc main(cArg)

   local nS := Seconds()

   Local oProfile := HB_Profile():new()
   __setProfiler( .T. )

   clear screen
   E10Sec()

   oProfile:gather()
   memoedit( HB_ProfileReportToString():new( oProfile:timeSort()
):generate( {|o| o:nTicks > 0 } ), 1,,,, .F. )

return

function E10Sec()

   local nS := Seconds()

   while Seconds() - nS <= 10
   enddo

return nil


And this is profiler result:



Name                                Type       Calls    Ticks       Seconds

=================================== ========== ======== ===========
===========
E10SEC                              Function          1        1001
10.00
SECONDS                             Function     508363         733
7.00
SCROLL                              Function          1           1
0.00


As you can see E10Sec() ran for exaclty 10 seconds.

I see three things here:

1) In more complex cases, like the one I posted earlier, calculation of
ticks spent is not correct
2) Since this sample ran for 10 seconds E10Sec() time spent should not be
reported as 10 sec but as 3 seconds since 7 seconds were spent inside
Seconds()  (Yes, questionable)
3) A division factor of 100 is correct for OS/2 EMX GCC

Message-ID: <3B71A252.47D38086@libero.it>

I've found where the problem lies, but I don't know how to fix it:

first I changed my sample this way:

proc main(cArg)

   Local oProfile := HB_Profile():new()
   __setProfiler( .T. )

   clear screen
   E10Sec(Seconds())

   oProfile:gather()
   memoedit( HB_ProfileReportToString():new( oProfile:timeSort() ):generate(
{|o| o:nTicks > 0 } ), 1,,,, .F. )

return

function E10Sec(nS)

   while Seconds() - nS <= 10
      inkey(1)
      E10Sec(nS)
   enddo

return nil

As you can see E10Sec() is now recursive and calls itself on an one second time
interval basis.

Now have a look at profiler output:


Name                                Type       Calls    Ticks       Seconds
=================================== ========== ======== =========== ===========

E10SEC                              Function         12        6600       66.00

INKEY                               Function         11        1100       11.00

E10Sec() spent 66 seconds!!!

This is because inside hb_vmDo if a functions calls itself its time is
calculated for every recursive call and not for the topmost only.

And Esegui() in my previous post is a recursive call as well.

regards.

And because E10() actually takes 11 seconds to run (because you use <=
10 instead of < 10), you get the sum of all the ticks from 100 through
1100, in steps of 100, which totals 6600.

Yes, I got the confirmation of this; Jose LaLin say that first place that it
look for is the current dir.
so if the user current dir is /usr/local/harbour/tests I can create the

As you've demonstrated the problem I had in mind isn't the problem here.
What isn't reliable, in a cross-platform sense, is the function that is used
to calculate the time spent within a function. It works ok on some platforms
but doesn't seem to work right on others.

Well spotted. Antonio is the best person to comment on this as he's the

Ok, I implemented the automatic synchronization with each module, but added
ability to disable it with -kr.

Ron/Dave,

I think the reason why runtime control of macro behaviour is needed
as well as compile-time control is this: in case an OBJ/LIB which was
compiled with the non-Clipper behaviour is linked into an app which
wants the Clipper behaviour.  (Or the inverse.)

The above should never happen with the -Z compiler option.

The above runtime control is only required if Clipper's macro
behaviour is extended e.g. in the way Ron has apparently already done.

If the runtime control isn't available then the practical effect may
be that add-on LIBs which use macroing may need to be made available
compiled in each of the settings. :-(

John.

You lost me I think.  Why should it be necessary?  A list expression
does not have to be in parens inside a code block so it could just as
easily not have to be inside parens inside a macro.

That's one POV but not the only one.  Another would be that &cMacro
is runtime evaluation and not really connected with substitution or
text manipulation.  One POV is that macroing is done to get a value
(and/or side effects of e.g. a function call).  Referring to it as
substitution can be misleading - it's about as true as saying aArr[i]
is substitution or len(cStr) is substitution.  In a sense they are,
but it strikes me as using English in a manner likely to cloud thought.

No.  It's only right given your POV.  From another POV it's wrong. :-)

I accept you think that.  However, there's an alternative way to
handle those examples.  Which of the ways is closer to the "spirit" of
Clipper is hard to say.  If one thinks of Clipper as an Xbase compiler
then your suggested way looks to me to be contrary to that.  However,
if one thinks of Clipper as primarily Xbase then it's arguably more
appropriate.

Me too, but the Harbour project doesn't exactly shine in that respect,
unlike many other community/free/open/whatever projects.

BTW, now that it's been pointed out that Clipper allows a macro to
be a list when inside a code block, I'm convinced that Nantucket
thought this through but didn't describe it in the shipped docs.  I
think Harbour should stay strictly Clipper compatible as regards
macroing a string containing a comma-separated list.

John.

Clipper's doc. is overall quite good, but hopelessly inadequate for
some purposes.  It is incomplete and/or imprecise in many areas.  It
also frequently does not explain the thinking behind many features.
E.g. lists/codeblocks/commas. :-(

I think this is a case where we cannot resolve the behaviour with the
doc.

Supporting or maintaining code is almost certain to be much harder if
some C is present.  Even harder still if one doesn't realise it's
present because it's lurking inline in a PRG.

Partly it is - we need to be very aware that we're changing what
Clipper does.  In effect, we're doing language design, which is "like
a stroll in the park" according to Larry Wall IIRC.  Jurassic Park. :-(

Maybe.  But we're guessing that's so.  We're also guessing as to how
Nantucket would've extended the support.

The macro feature is more limited than what the compiler (clipper.exe)
can do.  It looks sensible to be guided by the compiler.

That supports my argument. :-)  Actually, I think it tends to show
that Nantucket took care to prevent commas being macroed, except in
a code block.  That would argue for staying Clipper compatible, i.e.
not extending the macro feature to accept commas in other contexts.
So, both your meaning of SomeFunc( &cMacro ) and mine would be ruled
out.

OK, you've convinced me that Nantucket thought this through but didn't
describe it in the shipped docs.  I think Harbour should stay strictly
Clipper compatible as regards macroing a string containing a
comma-separated list.

I tend to agree, except in the case of a list.

I try hard to be open-minded.  I'm reluctant to re-design Clipper.

It doesn't work except on the basis that a list inside a macro means

I compiled some code.  The result is not my idea of "perfectly".
My initial thoughts were "weird" and "obscure".

The heritage and usage of macro substitution says otherwise doesn't it?

The getting of a value or the calling of a function is, logically, something
that happens after the expansion/substitution has taken place. That's how I
recall macro substitution working in the likes of dBase and FoxBase and, to
a large extent, that's how it's "supposed" to work in Clipper too (with the
obvious exceptions under discussion).

I refer to it as substitution *because* it is so different from expression
evaluation. From a dBase/Clipper programmers point of view, when you've got
code like this:

,----
| c := "aArr[ i ]"
| n := &c
`----

you expect two things to happen on the second line. First you expect macro
substitution to take place. Second, you expect expression evaluation to take
place. I don't say "substitution" so as to be misleading, I say
"substitution" so as to highlight the difference.

Quite the opposite. I say "macro substitution" because that's its heritage.

I'd be very surprised to find that this is only my POV. There's a long

Ho no. That would be horrible. It would be the exact equivalent of allowing
a run-time control for ShortCuts (which is one of the macro settings we
control here). You see that would mean the author of a prg linking against
your LIB, may inadvertently override the requirement of your LIB modules.

You should be able to *dictate* at compile time, that your LIB is *immune*
from effect of such Run-Time control.

Of course, and the same is true here.

No. It also controls other Harbour extensions, like Var++ Var+= and so many
other such extensions.

No exactly the opposite, it means your LIB is *guaranteed* to work and be
completely *protected* from any such runtime control, if you so desired.

Is that how you explain lack of support for Var++, Var+=, etc.?

Is that how you explain lack of support for nested Codeblocks?

If you think it was intended, can you try and explain why? Or maybe you
expect me to adopt the attitude that "we are just not clever enough to
understand why Nantucket Gods did what they did, but there must be a
perfectly good reason for it?

If the above are clear omissions, why would you try to find [non-existent]
logic in such omissions?

I find this extremely prejudiced. I can't understand what will make any form
of C code harder to maintain, compared with any other language, including
Clipper or Harbour, for those who made the decision to use the language they
chose, for a given task.

How would your task be easier, if the C portion was missing, or sent in a
separate file?

We can make it work practically any way we want it to be, the question is
whether it would be logical, and consistent with the language hosting that
macro facility.

I suppose you would have to convince us of the *correctness*, and reasoning
behind allowing us to perform:

//---------------------------------------------//
cMacro := "SomeArray[ Index1, Index2, IndexN ]"
SomeVar := &cMacro
//---------------------------------------------//

and also:

//---------------------------------------------//
cMacro := "Index1"
SomeVar := SomeArray[ &cMacro ]
//---------------------------------------------//

but not:

//---------------------------------------------//
cMacro := "Index1, Index2, IndexN"
SomeVar := SomeArray[ &cMacro ]
//---------------------------------------------//

Before I can support your suggestion.

But why "except"? Surely we are entitled to be advised of the reasons. What

Unless you provide some reasoning for the odd behavior we are discussing, we
can't view it as a design specification. And thus it's nothing more then bug
fixing.

You can use -kc or -kch when compiling, to get the alternate behavior that
you seem to be happier with.

I know this to be historically true because I talked to the Clipper
developers about this subject when they removed the macro support after S97.
Had to rewrite code, too.

Ron, isn't this begging the question?  If someone who has made the decision
to learn and use Clipper as a language then runs into code of another,
possibly unknown language, would he not be discouraged?

This is *exactly* the recommendation I received from the Clipper developers.
They recommended using arrays for list processing of the kind you represent
above.  They claimed it was a better approach and faster.  It was a
deliberate decision on their part.

I am reminded of the reason xBase was established.  I don't know if this is
a clear example, it is almost a frustrating one, but dBase was originally
written in Basic to provide an easy-to-use language for business
applications.  It wasn't written to be the ultimate programming language and
actually cut across sound programing concepts to provide quick solutions
designed for application.  It was a very simple language and elegant because
it was able to solve problems without introducing complexity.  It had
symmetry where it was needed, but relied upon singular solutions (I am
thinking of the "total on" command) when the business model asked for
simplicity.

Sorry, but I must dispute the above. I was a beta tester for 5.0, and had
numerous contacts with Nantucket throughout those years. My clear
recollection is, this was never intentional in a design context, but rather
an awareness/acceptance of a limitation which was down played, since macro
was now kind of a '2nd class citizen' in lieu of Codeblocks.

I meant to say not "after S97" but "with S97".   Yes, support of macros
suffered with the introduction of alternative programming techniques.  It
was a deliberate decision with S97, however reluctant.

I guess you mean S87.

Are you trying to suggest that removal of list macro support, was a design
specification?

You suggest they decided Clipper would be a better language without it?

You suggest they considered its omission from Clipper 5.x in comparison to
previous versions of Clipper, and all versions of dBase, FoxPro etc. an
intended advantage?

I beg to differ. I *know* it was not implemented for lack of interest when
balanced against the scope of the hardship/complexity involved.

Don't seem to have any blocking issue here with the fread() code under
unix_os. There is a problem if you redirect stdin from a file, and use
inkey() to read it in the clipper code.. It works, but you have to take a
return value of 0 as being end of file. I think it may then be getting into
a sort of blocking situation otherwise.

stdout redirection seems to work fine. You mentioned earlier about gtstd
possibly being a null I/O driver. My feeling on this would be that as long
as gtstd is purely stdout based, you can always redirect it to nul anyway..

I just want gtstd to work with stdin/stdout, and provide expected console
functionality for ?/??, and straightforward horizontal positioning with
space/backspace/newline, which is what I hope is there with the update I
posted. I found with the current 1.21 version in cvs, newlines were either
being lost altogether in qout() output, or an extraneous newline was being
inserted when outputting on the max row position.

It would be nice to get a non-blocking read working for the non-unix
platforms.

  Yes. But compile time switches are controlling *compile time* 
generation of the pcode while the runtime setings are controlling 
generation of pcode during the runtime.

The compile time:
macro := "1,2"
SomeFunc( &macro )

The runtime:
macro := "1,2"
someExpr := "SomeFunc( &macro )" //this is from user input so the 
   // compiler will not be able to substitute the macro
somevar := &someExpr

 These settings control the way &macro is expanded - if it is a list of 
separate expressions or an invalid expression.
  If the module with the first example is compiled with macro list 
expansion enabled then it will be correctly expanded at runtime 
regardless of HB_SETMACRO() settings because the correct pcode is already 
placed so there is no need for additional sunchronization.

  The compile time switches have no connection with the runtime 
generation of the pcode in the second example thus compile time switches 
shouldn't control the runtime behaviour.
  The same is true for macro inside a literal array and an array index 
(taking aside any dangerous consequences and side effects of such 
behaviour).

  More problems are with LIST support which is related to macro list 
expansion. For example

LIST &macro

In Clipper and Harbour mode it will be preprocessed to:
__dblist( .T., { {|| &macro} }, ....

while in xbase compatibility mode (after the expression optimiser 
mangling):
__dblist( .T., { macro } ,,...)

  This breaks compatibility with other RDD which may always expect the 
array of codeblocks but also break early/late bindings of macro 
expression. In Clipper/harbour mode macro will be evaluated for every 
processed record while in xbase mode it will be evaluated only once (thus 
will ignore changes of the 'macro' value). 
  Again we need the compile time switch to control the generated pcode 
and a separate runtime switch to control the generation of pcode in case 
someone wants to macro compile __dblist() function like in this example:

cBlock := "{|param1| __dblist( .T., { {|| &param1} } )}"
EVAL( &( cBlock ), "someExpr" )

  See above, code compiled withe a given compile time switch will run as 
expected with no synchronization needed and regardless of the runtime 
mode.

  I hope the above explanation will clarify things a little.

  #pragma can be used to compile different parts of code however it will  
not help if someone needs to use the same code with different settings. 
If such code is a part of programmer's library used in many applications 
that it is more natural to move settings to the runtime to suppress 
recompilation of such library. 
  For example, as Ron pointed, the extended syntax provided by the macro 
compiler can cause problems in a context:
macro := "otherfield+=2"
REPLACE &somefield WITH &macro
when the data for macro evaluation can be entered by the user instead of:
macro := "otherfield+2"
then we need the possibility to disable such errors. However not always. 
If you divide your users as: dummy users, normal users and me 
(administators) then it is more natural to set the capabilities at 
runtime because the same procedure cannot be compiled with different 
settings and linked together. Creating three separate procedures is just 
wasting of time.

I know they did it, and described it in their change document when the new
software was introduced.  I know I had to code around it, and from all
reports it was not a poplular change.

I don't know that.  I believe, from talking to the developers, that they
thought Clipper would be a better language with the new logic constructs
they introduced, and they assigned priority in that direction.

Regarding Clipper.  Is it necessary that Harbour be different?  Harbour is a
*Clipper* clone that has not yet reached Beta.  Does this effort further the
road to a beta release?

I'd have to go back to see in which version the change was made.  Do I look
to this as an advantage?  I didn't at the time but I am not sure of the
ramifications at present.  If inclusion means libraries may or may not be
usable, then it is a decided non-advantage.  If inclusion implies the
Clipper, now Harbour, user will be faced with a major research project to
second-guess a miriad of exotic run-time and complier parameters with hours
of study and testing to determine side effects, then hell no!  That is a
barrier that has killed many projects.

> I beg to differ. I *know* it was not implemented for lack of interest when

Please keep in mind the poor innocent Clipper user who, embracing Harbour,
may have to retrace steps just to get to ground zero.  Symmetry is excellent
if it is simple and intutive.  It is called complexity or even fuzzy when it
isn't.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20010809203812.00a6f370@mail.demetec.net>

Hello,

I am trying to join to the harbour team... but for the moment I cannot even 
make a successful build! :-(
I am using Cygwin on a Win2000 machine.
Probably I am making some stupid mistake. Perhaps somebody can help me to 
find it!

Here is what I do:
I downloaded the CVS snapshot and unzipped it to t:\soft\harbour
I set the following environment variables
  set HB_ARCHITECTURE=w32
  set HB_COMPILER=gcc
  set HB_GT_LIB=gtwin
  set CYGWIN=NOGLOB

Then, in bash, I go to the harbour directory and invoke "make":
   bash-2.05$ pwd
   /cygdrive/t/soft/harbour
   bash-2.05$ make

First, there is a lot of things that work. For example, harbour.exe is made.
But gtwin.c seems to not work:
   gtwin.c:124: parse error before `s_HOriginal'
is the first message of a long series of error messages.

The make continues for some time before really abandoning for good.
Some of the last messages are:
  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-cygwin/2.95.3-5/../../../../i686-pc-cygwin/bin/ld: 
cannot find -lgtwin
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  make[2]: *** [ac_test.exe] Error 1


I downloaded the mailbox archive (file harbour.mbox) from
http://www.matrixlist.com/pipermail/harbour/
and searched it for the string "s_HOriginal".
I did not find anything.
So I decided to call for help: What am I doing wrong?

    ! Fixed missing/extra outputting of newline character in SetPos
      and Scroll functions

    ! Added output of BEL character for tone() calls, with tracking
      of system time to limit BEL outputs to 1 per second max

    I've only tested this under GNU/linux and gcc. The ReadKey is still
    only implemented for UNIX_COMPATIBLE_OS.

    Redirection of stdin/stdout still works ok. To preserve the ability
    to accept redirected stdin, I think maeans there should never be
    remapping of any keycodes in this driver. Would be nice to have a
    way to pass in ALT-C though.

He must be using an older version. Current PP does close the PPO file
correctly.

Here is the code segment, starting at line# 2523:

   IF ProcName(2) == ""
      FClose( hPP )

      IF bCCH
         CompileToCCH( sSource )
      ENDIF
   ENDIF

He can add an Alert() message and confirm this.

Yes, and it's natural that compile time setting will serve as the default
for the run-time setting.

This is where we disagree. I believe it's more natural to expect that the
default run-time setting for compiling the macro in 2nd example should be
taken from the compile time setting, rather then some arbitrary default.
Even more problematic is the fact, that if the developer must rely on
run-time setting, he must SAVE + SET + RESTORE all flags for each macro
activation. It also means that had he not done so, his macros will produce
un-expected results when linked with code that makes use of HB_SETMACRO().

Wow, how can you be so dishonest? Why spread unfounded fears [again]?

1. RDD does NEVER get any Array related to anything to do with __dbList()!!!
RDD ALWAYS evaluate just ONE single value resulting from evaluation of a
CodeBlock within __dbList().

2. Flex version of Harbour does NOT even support early/late binding of
macros - Check tests/tstblock.prg!

3. The macro sample you provided &Macro is an EARLY form, and should be
evaluated only once!

4. You claim that the user of the LIST command should be aware of early/late
binding of CodeBlocks??? You think he should be aware of such low level
undocumented implementation detail, and possibly change the value of Macro
*during* the execution of the LIST LOOP??? Do you really understand where
are you going with this?

5. You know that the compile time setting is what determines the
optimization of a prg level __dbList(), and if someone created a macro to
call __dbList() it would not have to use a nested macro for the value,
because the __dblist() macro is already in string form (composed in run
time)!!! And *if* he did use a nested macro for some reason, he would expect
it to behave according to the same setting he used for his prg level
__dbList() won't you think?

6. If one still wanted for any reason, to have an independent run-time
setting for macro, to be determined by HB_SETMACRO() and not the compile
time setting he will just use -kr, right?

That's absolutely false! If the macro used any Harbour extension for
Example:

   cBlock := "{|param1| __dblist( .T., { {|| param1++ } } ) }"
   EVAL( &( cBlock ), "someVarOrField" )

It will *BREAK* unless the run-time setting supports the Harbour extension.
This will be *guaranteed* to work with the automatic synchronization,
regardless of how many modules are involved, and what different setting each
requires.

Don't you agree that for all macros, the developer *must* know the required
run-time support in compile time. Or else he couldn't even use
HB_SETMACRO(). The only [extremely rare] exception would be someone who
specify the HB_SETMACRO() arguments based on run-time determination. We both
know, this is very rare, but for this purpose the -kr is available.

Exactly for this kind of need the -kr is available.

Oops, silly me, the first line above is wrong (in that context). Have him

  Sorry, I have over-simplified the whole thing. All what I have wrote 
earlier is true for xbase compability only - because only in xbase mode, 
we are generating different pcodes. These are really cases where there is 
no need for synchronization because the pcode cannot be changed at 
runtime.

  Yes, problems can appear in the case clipper-harbour compatibility 
where the same pcode is generated. For example:

macro := "somevar++"
SomeFun( &macro )

Since the macro expansion will take a place at runtime then the macro 
compiler will check the compatibility mode during compilation. If this 
code is compiled with harbour compatibility and the runtime is set to 
Clipper mode then we have problem here. We can solve it with:
- add some synchronization code, as Ron have done it
- ignore any synchronization and use the runtime settings only

  We can discuss ,,what is more natural'' for the very long time however 
there is no point in such discussion. Just give the programmer the choice.

  In other words if someone will find the better method to:
- allow to disable/enable Ron's additions to the macro list compilation 
and __dblist support which breaks Clipper compatibility (regardless if we 
agree that it is either a Clipper bug or carefully choosen design)
- allow to disable/enable extended harbour macro capabilities 
(compilation of ++, +=, etc) at runtime
  These two items are complicated with the fact that the first problem is 
resolved with different pcode generation at compile time while the second 
is generating the same pcode at compile time but is checked at runtime by 
the macro compiler.

  But any RDD can implement his own __dblist function to properly handle 
passed array of codeblocks.

  What it has common with the __dblist?

Look for this example:
PROC MAIN
LOCAL macro
PRIVATE var

var :=1
macro :="IIF((var%5)==0, '===', STR(var,3))"
Test( {|| &macro} )

PROC TEST( bBlock )
LOCAL i
  FOR i:=1 TO 20
     ? EVAL( bBlock )
     M->var++
  NEXT
RETURN

  If it a macro is evaluated only once then you should see the same value 
repeated 20 times. If it is evaluated LATE then you will see something 
different. Just check it. This is simmilar code to __dblist().

  This is what Clipper is doing. Someone might find it usable. Do we 
really have to break compatibility here?

  Ron, the function which is called can have different source then the 
value. It is possible that someone cannot stringify all required values 
if the simple macro expression solve many problems.

  This is your point of view. I expect that the runtime settings will be 
used.

  Yes, sorry. I have auto-suggested with the xbase compatibility issues

  Then why you are arguing for macro list support so strongly? Give the 
programmer the possibility to choose what he wants instead of nonsense 
arguments. Don't enforce some behaviour because different programmers 
might have different needs.

Because the author of the algorithm should know whether -Z is needed
or not, and compile appropriately.  The user (i.e. caller) of the

I know you're trying to make a point but since I don't see things
that way I can't respond to this.  Akin to the "have you stopped
beating your wife?" question.

IAC, it's a moot issue now that it's been shown that Nantucket thought
this through and decided not to allow lists in macros except in code
blocks.  (See my other messages, which I think crossed with yours.)

It's a guess as to the reasons for the above.

It's clear (see previous messages) that lists in macros were intended
only to be allowed in code blocks.  One reason why may well be that
Nantucket thought people would have opposite views as to how they
should be handled and thus decided to reject them - forcing people to
specify what they want in an unambiguous way.

I don't say they are "clear omissions".  I've posted plenty of logic

I thought it was -kc or -kh?  I'm confused by these changing -k
things. :-(

That's all very well as regards my code.  However, -kc (Clipper-
compatible) needs to be the default for this (list macro) feature.
Otherwise you're overuling what Nantucket clearly did deliberately.  I
don't feel you've at all demonstrated that you know better than them.
New users of Harbour should get the Clipper behaviour by default
unless you're able to make a really good case for changing the
behaviour.

If Harbour is to allow such list macros, it would probably be a good
idea not only to doc how to enable it but also to mention the kinds
of code it will break.  It may be worth mentioning that there was a

It's my many years of experience about Clipper code which includes any
C.

You may not understand it, but my experience shows it to be so.

If there's no C the situation doesn't arise.  If it's in FILE.C then
it's rather obvious from the file name!

BTW, why you'd try to argue support-type issues with someone who's
done as much as I have beats me.

As I've said, I think Nantucket's actions show we should learn from
them - and be strictly Clipper-compatible.

As I've said elsewhere, it may be that Nantucket people were aware
that a list in a macro could have two meanings, except in a code block
where they took extra care in at least 2 ways(see below).  They may
well have decided to disallow the list macro except in a code block
in order to force people to use an unambiguous piece of code.

The two ways Nantucket took care with code blocks:
1. they allow a macro where it would not be ambiguous
e.g. {|| &cMacro }
2. they added an error message for other cases
e.g. {|| {&cMacro} }
this error also occurs for cases that would not be ambiguous; perhaps
they didn't see enough need to try to figure out which would be OK
and which not.  Note that they chose the "safer" (more restrictive)
route.

I don't know whether I can convince you.  However, the first two are
unambiguous whereas the latter is ambiguous - it's an example of the
very case where you want one behaviour and I originally wanted another
behaviour (but now I think Nantucket were right to disallow it).

Because it's not ambiguous.

Of course.  I thought it obvious. :-)

Ambiguity.  It would be great to avoid premature implementation and
endless threads, too.

I don't agree you can say "we" as you'd be speaking for others, whose
opinions are not yet known.  It's your opinion that it's a matter of
bug fixing.  I don't agree, and there's evidence Nantucket had good
reasons for what they did.

It may or may not be horrible.  It's not the same as runtime control
of short cuts (-Z switch), however.

But they may _need_ to do that, whereas they should never need to do
that with -Z.

If you do that, the LIB may not be of use.  E.g. the LIB macros
something then SEEKs it.  I pass in a string containing a comma.  The
LIB mistakenly treats what I've passed as a list.  But really it was
user bad input.

The above is an example.  No doubt there are many other possible
scenarios.

This is _not_ like anything that can happen with -Z.

In the example above, you're wrong.

And the same could be true of the workings of macro expansion too couldn't
it? The author of said OBJ/LIB might have written their code expecting macro
expansion to work a particular way.

I don't think it's fair to place my question in that sort of category. I'm
really failing to see how anyone can't see the obvious different between a
code block and macro expansion. To see then as similar would be like
suggesting that `lambda' and `eval' are similar in Lisp.

Why would you continue painting the list macro extension as breaking
compatibility, knowing that there are *factors* more of such extensions,
that you are responsible for, that you don't paint in that same negative
light - why?

1. Nonsense. Could it possibly implement it not even using codeblocks, thus
completely wiping your theory that LIST command features *are* bound to the
low level implementation details?

2. Any new implementation of __dbList() will simply take advantage of
HB_aExpressions() just like __dbList() does.

It has to do with your argument about early/late compatibility, when the
"formal" build of Harbour does *not* even support this feature!!! Now I know
why, it appears you don't yet understand this concept (read below).

This shows you don't understand the concept of early/late macro evaluation
in code block. Your sample above is using EARLY binding. The value of the
macro itself is only bound ONCE at the time the block is created. The
different value would be the same even if you didn't use macro at all! Maybe
the following [slight modification] can explain your mistake:

//-----------------------------------------------//
MEMVAR var, macro

PROC MAIN()

   PRIVATE macro
   PRIVATE var

   var :=1
   macro :="IIF((var%5)==0, '===', STR(var,3))"

   Test( {|| &macro } )
   Test( {|| &(macro) } ) // Now we use LATE binding - different MACRO value
will be used!!!

RETURN

PROC TEST( bBlock )

   LOCAL i

   macro := "'Late'" // Here we create new macro value, will only affect
LATE binding!!!

   FOR i:=1 TO 20
      ? EVAL( bBlock )
      var++
   NEXT

RETURN
//-----------------------------------------------//

Run the above with Clipper...

Do you *now* understand the difference between EARLY and LATE macro binding?
If you don't let me know, and I'll post more code to explain the issue in
more details.

We don't break compatibility, we offer the reduced Clipper macro support,
when using the -kc or -kh switch, just as with other Harbour extensions.

You were arguing it just as strong, were you not? We were both arguing
technical aspects, we both knew that both alternatives were already
available under user choice, for quiet some time.

I'm not against giving the user the ability to choose for him self, I never
was.

The question was as to *your* opinion. Do *you* consider it *intentional* or
an indication of *incompleteness*?

Do you consider the resulting Error Message a "proof" of the deliberate
intention behind this lack of support?

Please don't say that it's clear. It might be clear to you. I'm not alone
questioning your reasoning here.

John how could it be ambiguous, doesn't the Clipper documentation clearly
documents the difference between a list and a parenthesized list?

Do you consider this ambiguous:

   SomeFun( ( OtherVar := Prepared, NowParam ) )

   Or this:

   SomeFun( (1, 2, 3 ) )

as oppose to this:

   SomeFun( OtherVar := Prepared, NowParam )

   Or this:

   SomeFun( 1, 2, 3 )

If the above are not ambiguous (since they are allowed in clipper) although
producing complete different results, why would you claim that the macro
form of the above would be??? Also, why should I not be able to perform same
with macro, if allowed otherwise?

Which logic have you posted to explain lack of support for:

1. cMacro := "SomeVar++" // and all other forms of Pre/Post
Increment/Decrement.
2. cMacro := "SomeVar += SomeVal" // and all other forms of '?=' operator
2. cMacro := "( SomeVar := SomeVal, OtherVal )"

I don't suppose you consider any of the above ambiguous do you? If you
contend these are not ambiguous, should we fix them or would such support be
considered "re-designing Clipper"?

Ryszard implementation of the -k uses -kc as resetting all extensions. You
can set your features request as follows:

-kc       // All extensions disabled.
-kch      // Only Harbour extensions, enabled.
-kcx      // Only xbase extensions enabled.
-kchx     // All extensions enabled (default).

-k[chx]r  // Will work as above plus indicate that Run-Time macro management
should be used (Auto Macro Synchronization disabled).

As a side effect to the implementation any -k[hx] that does *not* specify
'c' will have no effect.
As a side effect to the implementation any -k[hxr]c will ignore all flags
prior to the 'c' because the 'c' will reset all flags.

The above side-effects, are not bugs, and are documented in the code.

1. *Please* don't state, matter of fact, that such inconsistent and partial
implementation was "what Nantucket clearly did deliberately". You have never
established as much!

2. Have we demonstrated that we know better then them with regard to all
other default extensions?

3. What is the objective guiding principal as to when are we allowed to
"break" Clipper compatibility as the default Harbour behavior?

It will never break any code! The only code it effects, is code that would
produce an error in Clipper.

The only exception to the above is the LIST command, where such macro would
not produce an error in Clipper, but will only evaluate such values without
displaying them [other then the last].

Even under this exception, the Harbour extension will not "break" such code,
but simply display all values included in the macro (as would be expected by
anyone concerned with the command, rather then its incidental low level
implementation). Regardless, this enhanced behavior is already documented in
/docs/en/clipper.txt.

This thread was not an argument, but rather a question, which I sincerely
raised out of curiosity. As a side note, I've provided similar tech support
for probably just as many years, and I'm completely puzzled by your concern.

1. Clipper documentation as to interpretation of lists leaves no room for
ambiguity!

2. If I accepted your argument, what makes the list ambiguous in the
following form:

   Var := ( &Macro )

   Why is this not supported, although absolutely non ambiguous?

1. Lists are never ambiguous in Clipper syntax. You are the only person here
that claims such ambiguity.

2. You suggest we should take after their ["perhaps"] laziness?

How can you claim that the first 2 are not ambiguous, yet the last *is*?
What is the difference? What is the possible alternate meaning? What would
be the basis for assuming such alternate meaning?

But every other use of a list is just as unambiguous, including many other
contexts that even you agree are non ambiguous.
When do we consider it a bug, and when not?

The ambiguity is only there for anyone inventing alternate meanings to
lists, strictly against the documented non ambiguous nature of lists in
Clipper. This is indeed redesigning Clipper. Fixing the macro to fully
support the documented meanings is not re-designing Clipper, but rather
completing the implementation of macro.

Of course it is! Actually one of those flags is indeed the very same
(ShortCuts) flag.

Would you like to be able to control usage of ShortCuts in *your* macros at
compile time? Or would you leave that at the mercy of the consumer using
your lib?

Would you like to be able to control usage of Harbour extensions (like
Var++; Var += x; etc.) in *your* macros at compile time? Or would you leave
that at the mercy of the consumer using your lib?

Why would they need to override your specification of usage of ShortCuts in
macros in *your* modules?

1. But if you *intentionally* chose to support list macros, that is how it
must be interpreted. When you do choose to support list, you may apply logic
to evaluate/warn usage of commas within such macro, if you so desire.

2. If you enabled list support in run-time using HB_SETMACRO() before such
evaluation, you would still face the same dilemma, wouldn't you?

> This is _not_ like anything that can happen with -Z.

Of course it is, because:

  1. -z (HB_SM_SHORTCUTS) is indeed one of those flags under the
HB_SETMACRO() control.
  2. Enabling/Disabling Pre/Post Increments/Decrements against the intention
of the LIB supplier, would cause same kind of unexpected results, i.e.
chaos.

No, in your example above, the LIB is guaranteed to work exactly as the
author of the code intended for it to work. Unless he relegate the decision
to the user by means of compiling his code with -kr.

I'm inclined to agree with this. Clipper compatability first, 
extensions can be turned on by programmer who wishes to use them.

Default should always be Clipper compatability.

It can find any specific phrase, so you could specify something from a

I don't think I can produce source code to prove it, but I'm fairly certain
that a 'list' of 3 items is treated differently than any other.

This was done to special-case IIF( <x>,.t.,.f.)

Maybe it's only the parser that handles it differently, I don't know.

There are several differences.  Code blocks get the full PP and
compiler treatment, so can have #defines (etc), locals, statics, and
so on.  You're choosing a specific feature only, then describing it
using particular words.  Fair enough except that I don't really agree
with the choice of words. :-)

I don't agree.  (Again)

Regardless, the I do think it's important that:
(a) Nantucket people clearly thought this issue through and handled it
in specific ways (i.e. it's not chance that Clipper does what it does)
(b) lists in macros are ambiguous yet there are unambiguous ways to
specify the equivalents
(c) if implemented Ron's/your way, some code can be broken, and the
same would apply if implemented the way I originally suggested

For all 3 reasons I think we should stick with the Clipper-compatible
way, at least for the default.

Yes, it could be.  However, in some cases it may not be (see the
example I posted for Ron).  This is different with -Z, where the
author can (should :-) always be sure.

What example? Can you provide a Message-ID:?

Presumably the author can/should be sure due to the fact that shortcutting
is only controlled at compile time. Right?

John, I understand that you disagree, there's little doubt about that now.
What I'd be interested in is the "why".

> > To see then as similar would be like suggesting that `lambda' and `eval'

> 
> I don't agree.  (Again)

Why? In Lisp `lambda' creates closures of code that retain details of their
environment that can be passed around and evaluated at will. `eval' takes
text and treats it as code. the expansion happens for every instance of
`eval'. How does that differ from an outline explanation of code blocks and
the macro expansion operator in Clipper? Why do you disagree?

> (c) if implemented Ron's/your way, some code can be broken, and the

Please note that it's not "my way" and please note that I share many of your
reservations and that I voiced them while you were away (did you check the
URLs I provided you with a while back?). I'm not personally advocating this
enhancement to the macro compiler but I am saying that I think your
interpretation of an expanded list in a function argument list isn't
consistent with reasonable expectation of how macro expansion works.

I'm also saying, despite the fact that you've claimed it a couple of times
now, that I'm not playing with words. There's much more thought to what I'm,
saying that simply picking and choosing words that serve my purpose.

> For all 3 reasons I think we should stick with the Clipper-compatible way,
> at least for the default.

I agree that Clipper compatibility should be the default if at all possible,
I don't think I've suggested otherwise. All I'm interested in is why you
seem to have (what appears to me) an odd interpretation of how an expanded
list in a function argument list should be handled. I'm looking for
something a little more verbose and explanatory than "I don't agree".

Subject: [Harbour] -go and empty harbour.cfg
Message-ID: <20010813103024.X30092@hagbard.davep.org>

I just noticed something else with the -go switch. If I create an empty
harbour.cfg (I was double checking that the other problem I reported was
down to having no harbour.cfg) I get random "rubbish" on the screen, I think
it's being reported from the shell due to the fact that the command isn't
defined (or, more to the point, it's defined as random rubbish).

For example:

Message-ID: <20010813100648.W30092@hagbard.davep.org>

This is a test on my main GNU/Linux box. There is no harbour.cfg in sight so
I'm wondering if this is the problem (I would follow the problem all the way
but I'm a little short on time right now).

Given a simple program I compile it with "harbour foo -go" and get a
segfault:

It doesn't read as such a request.

I don't see its relevance to the issue under discussion.  I'd like to
avoid thread drift since I really don't have the time spare that I'm
already using!

There is evidence that Nantucket put in extra effort to detect lists
in macros and allow them in only specific cases.  What evidential-
based argument do you have to support your view?

As I thought you'd agreed, the doc. is not good enough in a number of
ways.  Please point me to the generic doc. you refer to above, since
I don't seem to be able to find it.

I've been trying to do so.  I've not made claims along the lines you

I understood it that way.  I didn't mean "argue" in a negative sense,

It's news to me that you regularly get sent other people's code/apps
including C code and provide support.  I can only say I almost always
find it much harder when the code I receive includes some C and that
I dread the idea of the C being obscured/hidden by being in a PRG.

My statement was in the context of list macros.  However, it's been my
understanding that in general Harbour is supposed to be Clipper
compatible first and foremost, with any changes discussed and agreed
and only the ones which are definitely not controversial being enabled
by default - if then.  I don't know how many people are happy or
unhappy with list macros being added already and enabled by default.

It might be considered ambiguous, depending on what's in cMacro.
As to why it's not supported, clipper.exe compiled it OK.  I believe
it treats the parens as denoting grouping (unnecessary in this case),
rather than an insistence as to the meaning of any potential list
macro, so at runtime you'll get the usual error if you pass a list.
The compiler probably treats the parens as denoting grouping because
that's what the intent was by design, and the doc. for parens is
consistent with that.

It's ambiguous because there are at least 2 ways to it could work:
(a) If #2 above were allowed, it would be reasonable to say the code
block should return an array of one element.  If cMacro contains a
list then either it's an error or it's treated as a comma expression
(thus evaluating each part of the list and returning the last value).
(b) Your opinion is that the number of elements in the array would
depend on how many items were in cMacro, when it's a list.

> 2. You suggest we should take after their ["perhaps"] laziness?

It's only an opinion as to whether it was laziness.  They put in extra
code to allow a list macro within a code block at runtime, and extra
code in the compiler to detect and allow / disallow some cases in a
code block.  That's not "laziness" to my way of thinking.

The first looks to be how arrays are implemented and doc'ed.  Surely
neither of us claims it's ambiguous.  The second also doesn't look
ambiguous.  If you're taking issue with my claims so far, please say
why.  The last one can be considered ambiguous in the same way as I
explained above:
(a) it can be regarded as an array with a single index (which if it
is a list macro is either an error or a comma expression)
(b) it can be viewed your way

I find it hard to believe you could not see these alternatives.  I
know you don't agree with case (a) but having to spell it out like
this does rather surprise me.

It's a bug when we change Clipper behaviour by default without very
compelling reasons.

I'd welcome a call for a vote, as this looks to be dragging on. :-(
The vote (IMO) would be whether this new code for list macros should
be enabled by default.

Above I show why they can be ambiguous.  Others and I have also posted
evidence that Nantucket people put in extra work in this area and
chose not to do what you're doing.  I've posted an example where your
change would break an app.  I do not regard all that as "Fixing".

You disagree that I've provided it or you disagree with what I wrote?
IAC, an opinion is not enough to dismiss the issue and force this
change on everyone by default.  At least, an opinion isn't enough
when there's reasoned dissent and no vote has been taken.

Ron,

It's not a real question for me personally (I never use -Z, hardly
ever use macros, they don't involve short cuts, etc).  Also, I regard
-Z as only there for short term transition of S87 (etc) users who've
not yet made changes (if any) needed such that they can stop using -Z.

Given the above, that's moot.

Not really.  However, I don't think I've any objection to such control
being available.

Pass.  (My LIBs use almost no macros.)

I don't, sorry.  Besides, you're not using the situation I posted,
which was meant to be the use of short cuts within a LIB, outside of
macros - i.e. the common situation.

But then it would not be "user bad input".  Since I stated "really it
was user bad input", you're supposed to answer based on that.  It's a
given, for the example stated.

There's no dilemma in the above example.  It's stated what the desired
behaviour is.  If HB_SETMACRO() would break that, it shouldn't be used.

Let's finish with list macros.  In passing, however, it looks to me
like the settings for list macros and the above should be separate,
since list macros can be ambiguous but the above may not be.  The
default should be disabled, I feel, to retain Clipper compatibility.

You appear to have completely misunderstood the example.

Sometimes there can be objective reasons, but not always.  The array
limit of 4096 looks like a compromise based on 16-bit and fairly
small free RAM.  So, that's probably more objective than subjective.
There's evidence about list macros, so that also looks more objective
than subjective.  Your opinions look the opposite to me.

I'm not sure that's true, but to deal with such code can be what the

Not true.  My example is another.  There may well be more.

However, since there are now at least 2 cases where an app can be
broken by your change, I again say that I feel your change should not
be enabled by default.

I've known Dave about as long as most of the Harbour developers.

Dave may be pedantic and a little argumentative.  He always uses words
VERY precisely though.  When he might seem to be arguing for the sake of
a fight, it's usually a good idea to rethink your assumptions--because
he's usually making a subtle point that is easily missed.

All that having been said, I have no opinion on the matter at hand.

Dave,

> What I'd be interested in is the "why".

That doesn't appear to fit the context of the part that was above.

As I've posted, some specific cases of macroing lists can be ambiguous
(I've posted details again today) and ambiguity is not something I
think should be added.  However, supposing we'd had a vote and decided
to go ahead, my main feeling is that this feature should not be
enabled by default.  The "why" is because it can break existing code
and/or people's expectations.

In case your "why" was about:
> I'm really failing to see how anyone can't see the obvious different
> between a code block and macro expansion
I've already answered that I do see them as different, though not
necessarily as fitting the words you used to describe macros, so did
you want more or what?

> Why?

I think what I really meant was something along the lines of: I don't
see why because List has specific things that this should influence
what we do in a specific case which can be taken to be ambiguous, and
which Nantucket put extra effort into disallowing, and I especially
don't see why we'd enable this new feature by default.  If Lisp really
addresses those issues as far as a Clipper developer is concerned, do
explain. :-)

I see only a few people commenting.  Not enough. :-(  If most Clipper
developers really would expect a macro to function the way Ron feels,
fair enough.

However, I still don't think it should be enabled by default.

> I agree that Clipper compatibility should be the default if at all poss=
ible,

:-)

> I don't think I've suggested otherwise.

Sorry - very likely you haven't.  You did seem to be supporting Ron,
and he's made it clear that he wants it his way (i.e. not Clipper
compatible) by default.

> All I'm interested in is why you seem to have (what appears to me)

> list should be handled.

Since one of Clipper's major things was that it's a compiler, and
  SomeFunc( <param1> )
is clearly a func with a single param, it looks consistent that when
<param1> is &cMacro then it's still a func with a single param.  It's
not as if there's no other way to achieve the equivalent of Ron's way
of handling this.

However, I actually don't feel fanatically about this at all - but I
do think the change made should not be enabled by default.  I think
you got that message, though. :-)

The main "why" I'm interested in is why someone should expect this:

,----
| cMacro := "1, 2, 3"
| Foo( &cMacro )
`----

to work out as a function being called with a single parameter. I don't
disagree that there's some useful debate to be had regarding how advisable
allowing the above is. What I'm interested in here is why anyone would see
the above as ambiguous. The existence of such ambiguity is, from where I'm
sat, at the heart of any "should we/shouldn't we" debate about the macro
expansion of lists.

As I've posted earlier, macro expansion has a heritage of being just that,
macro expansion. Back in the late 80s I was writing code that constructed
whole commands and then macro expanded them. From a dBase developers point
of view that's what the macro operator did, it did text replacement and/or
expansion (from a logical POV, not an implementation POV).

Now, as we all know, (Nantucket-)Clipper had to things slightly differently
so you could get away with macro expanding who commands and the like. Even
less so with (Nantucket-)Clipper 5.0 due to the compiler more or less
loosing any knowledge of commands.

My point here is that the "why" of me saying that this:

,----
| cMacro := "1, 2, 3"
| Foo( &cMacro )
`----

would appear to be "unambiguously" a function call with three parameters is
based on the reasoning and experience that I've reported earlier and have
given a summary above. I don't have a dBase/Fox to hand but the reasoning is
the same that would have had me thinking that this:

,----
| m->macro = "1, 2, 3"
| do foo with &m->macro
`----

would call a procedure with three arguments (he says, probably getting very
mixed up with the various dialects of "Xbase").

So, the "why" I'm wondering about is "why" you think the above case is
ambiguous.

Agreed, see the URLs I posted the other day. I'm still not sure about this
ambiguity though. Or, more to the point, I'm still not sure about the source
of the ambiguity.

It's not about addressing Clipper development concerns. I gave the
lambda/eval example to illustrate what I was saying about code blocks and
macro expansion as being very different things. The former creates a
"closure" of code that contains some binding to the parent environment and
it can be passed around the application and evaluated at will. Macro
expansion has none of those properties.

More to the point, code blocks are a data type, "&" is an operator. You'd be
hard pushed to find two things any more different.

Put another way, the lambda/eval similarity illustration was given to show
that when I asked:

,----
| But a code block isn't a code substitution mechanism is it?
`----

it wasn't intended as a question that falls into a:

,----
| "have you stopped beating your wife?
`----

category. Feel free to pick an illustration that isn't Lisp inspired.

I believe that Ron's interpretation of list expansion within a function call
context (as illustrated above) is consistent with reasonable expectations of
macro expansion (the "why" of my "reasonable expectations" has be
re-documented above). That, however, isn't a judgement of the value of such
a feature.

The number of people commenting seems to be the same as the upper limit of
people who care.

I'm not supporting anyone, I'm especially not supporting the pro/con of the
default value of a given switch. I am, however, attempting to draw out the
reasons for your differing opinion in regard to what I've said about the
source of my "reasonable expectation".

Personally I'd defer such a decision until I knew the content of cMacro.

Agreed, I do think that, as much as possible, any possibly "invasive"
enhancements to the language should be off by default. Within reason anyway.
I can't imagine that anyone could have a reasonable objection to that.

 Shouldn't be in the mainwin.c the following line:

     hb_hInstance = hInstance;

 ? Currently it is initialized to 0 and doesn't updated somewhere.

That's not a avoiding a drift but rather avoiding the issue. I know first
hand of many omissions in Clipper's macro compiler and subsequent
discussions *I* personally had with higher level Nantucket personnel, that
made it crystal clear, that the macro compiler was (described in what to me
appeared as clear excuse) a lower priority.

Your attempt to ignore the obvious many many inconsistencies in Clipper's
macro compiler, as irrelevant to this discussion, is questionable imo.

After having implemented some of the missing support, it became even
clearer, that Nantucket developers, simply "cut corners".

Had you reviewed the code in question, and implemented such yourself, I'm
confident you'd feel the same.

Take for example the *fact* that *extremely* *simple* *to* *correct*
*bugs*,like lack of support for: Var++; ++Var; Var--; --Var; Var += exp (an
all other operator assignment), were *never* *corrected* in so many years
from 5.0 to 5.01, 5.1, 5.2(abcde) 5.3(ab). Doesn't that demonstrate the lack
of commitment to the completeness of the macro compiler?

The fact that they realized (what you would have known too had you
familiarized yourself with the relevant compiler code) that supporting the
list in codeblock did NOT require any additional logic, and could have been
easily excused from the otherwise error message, does *not* place it that
light you attempt to place it under. The technical facts, clearly
demonstrate, this was a "layman's decision". I'm confident most of us have
been "guilty" of this kind of a "crime" one time or another.

But we are talking about a well known behavior, that practically everyone
take advantage of, in infinite contexts. Its literally part of the
characteristics of the language. Even if there would have been no
documentation about it at all, you couldn't [successfully] argue its clear
and unambiguous place in the Clipper language.

I disagree. I believe that closing your eyes to the number of clear problems
with the Clipper macro bugs, and desperately trying to make some sense of
it, qualify as attributing to the Nantucket developers an un-earned, not to
be questioned,  superiority [in this context].

  hInstance is a handle of an application instance, we get it as a
  parameter of WinMain() and should store it in some public variable (
  hb_hInstance ) for following using in some functions, for example,
  loading icons, bitmaps from resource file.

It does not affect the app behavior at all.

It is just that we have a "saved" value, in the case that
we may need it further on the app.

Though, in fact, it is not needed as Win API

Implementing the complete and proper macro support, for those interested in
complete macro functionality, does not take away from our ability to specify
the default functionality level. If we found out that any of the macro
extensions is/are unpopular, one assignment of the default value will have
to be changed.

My above statement should be revised to read <Clipper compiler
interpretation of lists leaves no room for ambiguity!> because I'm unable to
locate any reference to lists where one would expect under '()' operator. Do
you dispute that lists, parenthesized vs. non parenthesized, have a clear
and unambiguous meaning in the Clipper language?

Please don't avoid the issue, again how is it ambiguous in light of this:

   Var := ( 1, 2, 3 ) // Non ambiguous for Clipper, produces valid
assignment of last element value
                         ( after evaluation of all sub-expressions, first).
   Var := 1,2,3       // Non ambiguous for Clipper, produces compile time
error.

   cMacro := "1, 2, 3"
   Var := ( &cMacro ) // Syntax error on ',' though acceptable in same exact
context elsewhere (codeblock).
   Var := { &cMacro } // Syntax error on ',' please note:
                         There is *no* ambiguity, as to the suitability of
lists in this context.

   cMacro := "{ 1, 2, 3 }"
   Var := &cMacro     // Non ambiguous for Clipper or Macro Compiler,
produces assignment of array from list.

   cMacro := "( 1, 2, 3 )"
   Var := &cMacro     // Syntax error on ',' though:
                         1. Acceptable in Clipper as grouped list.
                         2. Acceptable in Macro Compiler in similar context
of literal arrays lists.

Why should it not treat the expended macro as it treats any other compile
time expression?

But John, it shouldn't be about how me or you interpret it, it should be
treated *exactly* as if the expended macro was literal text provided in
compile time!!!

If you were familiar with the underlying code, you would have known, that's
not true. They didn't have to add any logic, they just excused the list from
the error in the context of block, because it was trivial (no additional
logic was needed), the default behavior of the compiler is to push/pop all
expressions but the last, which is only pushed. Had they care enough they
would have excused Var := ( &cMacro ) too, because again no added logic
would be needed. Supporting all other contexts on the other hand, required
*significant* and/or *challenging*, and/or *laborious*, extra logic.

1. What would be the basis of interpretation a?
2. Could it not be the same kind of "error" when entered literally in the
prg?
3. Why would the prg compiler follow strict language syntax, yet macro
compiler be allowed to see ambiguity?

Not as much as I'm surprised that your argument allows for the macro

Just check above, didn't you say:

   this error also occurs for cases that would not be ambiguous; perhaps
   they didn't see enough need to try to figure out which would be OK
   and which not.

That would be self serving would it not? Why would you choose to ignore the

No, above you insist on allowing a *different* set of syntax rules for 2

I disagree that you provided reasoning. Between the above 2 options I would
select "disagree with what you wrote", but I meant a little more than that.

There were no "others", and there were no "factual" evidence. There was one
individual, who described a *general* interpretation *he* made, based on
replies from Nantucket to concerns he had. I personally had *intense*
discussions with Nantucket Beta Team, and have the exact opposite
recollection. I did press them with more specific questions/challenges, and
because I do have *clear* recollection of the questions/challenges
responses, and because I now have intimate knowledge of the code involved, I
consider my "testimony" more material ("factual") to this debate.

John, not specifying -z *is* an explicit decision to *do* use shortcuts in
your code.

If your code has:

   IIF( Exp1 .OR. Exp2, ... )

Where Exp2 *must* *only* be evaluated *if* Exp1 produces a .F. value, The
above *will* produce erroneous results if -z was to be specified.

Now, if you had the above in a macro, the same erroneous results would be
produced, *unless* you could as the author of such code, to specify that the
above code *must* use logic shortcuts.

So the question remains:

   Would you like to be able to *control* (i.e. enable or disable - in your

Not at all! If I used your macro (which assumes Shortcuts are enabled) and
disabled ShortCuts in my code, your macro would have produced erroneous
results.

If you use *any* macros (even if was just one single one), you have to be

No. if you *chose* to support lists in macros, it means *you* deliberately*
preferred the logical need to evaluate multiple expressions, *over* the
possibility of an error. It also means that you can peek at the macro, and
make some educated analysis, before any evaluation. If you didn't, this same
macro would have produced an *error* anyway. Because lists are not supported
in Clipper in this context of function argument.

Sorry, I just can't understand. We were arguing the need for compile-time
vs. run-time control of macro extensions. You specified an example of
possible ambiguity, between an error context, or intended multiple
expression. My point is that if you chose to see such ambiguity in the
above, same would be true, if the enabling was done in run-time would it
not?

1. All extensions groups are already separated. I'm lost as to your final
point though.

2. Do you see the same ambiguity in:

      cMacro := "Field1 -= (Exp)"

   ???

   Since Clipper does *not* support the above and will produce an error,
   is it possibly it was an input error attempting to do:

      cMacro := "Field1 == (Exp)"

   This group of numerous Harbour extensions, will definitely "break" much
more
   code then the list macro. Should we disable it by default too?

1. Again there were no "others". There was one individual fairly vague
statement.

2. I've posted numerous examples, of numerous inconsistencies, and bugs, in
Clipper's macro compiler demonstrating it should be perceived as an
*in*complete body of work.

3. I've posted testimony about my explicit recollections, from my personal
experience, debating this very same issue, as a Clipper 5 beta tester, and
the responses I got from high level Nantucket personnel, which clearly did
*not* attempt to present any logic, or reasoning, for such inconsistencies
and omissions, but instead dismissed them as lower priority issues!

4. I've had the opportunity to get intimately involved with the code in
question, and was able to understand first hand, the obstacles the Nantucket
developers have faced, and could experience first hand, the frustration of
having to resolve the omissions, and how it involves real creative, and
laborious, solutions.

You can be unsure, it will not change this very simple fact, with the

Please prove with code sample. Please show code that does *not* involve the
LIST command, and does *not* produce an ERROR in Clipper, that will produce
different results in Harbour, if list support in macros is enabled.

No there are no 2 cases!

1. No Clipper code the does *not* produce an ERROR will *not* be effected
when enabling list supports in macro!

2. The Clipper behavior, of list in macro while not producing an ERROR is
ERRONEOUS!

3. wonder how many Clipper users will agree with you that the following is
the expected Clipper behavior for:

   cFields := "FIELD->F_Name, FIELD->L_Name, FIELD->Age"
   LIST OFF &cFields

   a. R/T Error, because Clipper does not support macros of list as per
Clipper documentation.


   b. Display as follows:

            30

      because LIST arguments are implemented by means of codeblocks, which
although
      are not documented to support macros of list, in effect do, and since
lists
      in block will evaluate all expressions, but only produce the last
value, thus
      output of above code should only display the FIELD->Age.

   c. Display as follows:

      John     Skelton             30

      because this is what my code intended to do, that's how it worked in
my previous
      Clipper version, and that's how it worked in dBase, before I upgraded
to Clipper.

   What would you honestly think will be the *least* likely selected answer
if we queried every Clipper user on earth?

Do you really think that the Clipper user is supposed to be intimately
familiar with low level implementation, and understand that it's ok for the
macro list to not produce an error, yet "swallow" some of his expressions?

Do you really think majority of Clipper users will agree with you that
behavior (b) above should be described as "breaking their app"?

John, I'm confident we both are too committed to our different approaches at
this stage, and I don't expect we can convince each other either way. We are
becoming redundant. Let's leave our disagreement as such.

I'm sorry, but I've extremely interesting subject I would like to explore,
and will not be able to devote the proper attention to this argument, any
more :-(

Sorry, but this code is NOT Clipper compatible, and uses a macro to build
the block, against the explicit advice in Clipper's doc.

Try this sample with Clipper:

//--------------------------------//
Procedure Main()

   LOCAL b1, b2

   //USE TEST

   b1 := FieldBlock( 'First' )
   b2 := FieldWBlock( 'Last', 1 )

   USE TEST

   ? Eval( b1 ), Eval( b2 )

return

//--------------------------------//

BTW, after some review it seems the CVS code is not Clipper compatible
either. The block will not raise an error if the field does not exist.

Here is a code that will emulate Clipper behavior:

Function FieldBlock( cFldName )

   IF ValType( cFldName ) == 'C'
      RETURN {|xSet, nPos| nPos := FieldPos( cFldName ), IIF( nPos > 0,
IIF( xSet == NIL, FieldGet( nPos ), FieldPut( nPos, xSet ) ), &( "FIELD->" +
cFldName ) ) }
   ENDIF

RETURN NIL

Function FieldWBlock( cFldName, nWa )

   IF ValType( cFldName ) == 'C' .AND. ValType( nWa ) == 'N'
      RETURN {|xSet, nPos| nPos := FieldPos( cFldName ), IIF( nPos > 0,
IIF( xSet == NIL, (nWa)->( FieldGet( nPos ) ), (nWa)->( FieldPut( nPos,
xSet ) ) ), &( "FIELD->" + cFldName ) ) }
   ENDIF

RETURN NIL

BTW, it seems Clipper is using an assembler code for this function, and it
uses few internals I'm not familiar with.

Here are the referenced symbols:

extrn   __acrtused
extrn   _VSTR
extrn   __get_sym
extrn   __sysflags
extrn   __param
extrn   __ipushblock
extrn   __lparam
extrn   __eval
extrn   __tos
extrn   __nScanId

Anyone familiar with _VSTR, or __nScanId?

So far they've not seemed too subtle.  Hmm... that probably means I've

Dave,

Sadly, I don't think that's necessarily so.  The problem revolves
around the case where there are multiple authors, e.g. in the case of
an add-on LIB.  The LIB may be written with one behaviour of macros in
mind, and the other code may have the other behaviour needed.  Fine
until the one needs to use (e.g. call) the other, passing in something
to be macroed.  There are two behaviours which could occur; whichever
does occur could be the opposite of what's wanted.

I posted an example (where the caller wants a runtime error but
instead the list macro is accepted).  It's a simplistic example
designed to show that the issue does exist.

I am at a complete loss to understand how you could possibly think
that I don't know that.  Well, I do.  I also know what follows from
not using -Z.  I also said very explicitly what I regard as the
reason for -Z's existence.

Based on what I posted, you won't be using any macro of mine that
could do that.

This is an example of the common situation:
  IF exp1 .AND. exp2
and I (the author) will have specified at compile time how I want it
to behave.  In my case I never use -Z, because I've never wanted and
plan never to want that behaviour.

I can then supply the compiled code as a LIB and know how it will be
executed.  There is no issue of wanting runtime control of the above
short cut.  This is different from the situation with adding the
ability to have a list in a macro, where such control can be needed.
The problem is that the caller of a function in a LIB may want the
opposite behaviour to what the LIB author wants.  I think these can't
be reconciled by Harbour, if such a list macro is allowed.  I think
the LIB author would have to state what the situation is, or provide
two versions.

OK - you talked me into the ground. :-(

I'd like to hold onto just one thing: let's have list macros disabled
by default.

I stated a situation.  "No" rejects that example's stated basis.  I
see no basis for a discussion here. :-(

I didn't.  The example didn't want the behaviour you've added.  The
example stated that.  Your change breaks the example.

Were we?  I'm just arguing that this new macro behaviour should be
off by default.  (I've also pointed out that a list in a macro could
be seen as ambiguous, but that's minor compared to the new feature
being on by default.)

It looks simple (to me): the extensions, but particularly list macros,
should be disabled by default.

The _relevant_ compiler code is that present inside clipper.exe and
the libs.  You're claiming I could have familiarised myself with
those?  If you legally have the source code, please send it to me,
again if you legally can.  I'd be delighted to familiarise myself.

Of course, you mean _Harbour_ compiler code.  As an argument about how
easily Nantucket or CA could have added the extra macro features, it's
irrelevant how easy or hard it may be to change _Harbour_ code.

It wasn't me that appealed to the doc for support - it was you.  I've

I've not been "closing your eyes"; it's not "clear" that what you call

You'd do better to stick to more helpful debate as I said before (see
above).  See also your own request about "valid technical reason",
then maybe re-reading your comments about me "closing your eyes", etc
would be a good idea.

I don't see any valid reason why the extensions should need to be
found out to be "unpopular".  Harbour is supposed to be Clipper
compatible, with rare exception.  This may be one of those exceptions
but I don't think so.

But Clipper's interpretation is a runtime error.  Does kind of argue
for Harbour doing the same by default. :-)

I do dispute it, yes.  I have opinions as to what was intended.  I
don't know for sure what was intended.  This is a problem.

I think you'll also find that comma (,) is not even in the list of
operators. :-(

Where is it doc'ed so as to be "non ambiguous"? ;-)  But I believe I

Harbour could be given that behaviour.  If so, I don't see any good
reason for it to be enabled by default.  We don't know why Clipper
isn't the way you want.

Where is Clipper defined like that?  In your mind, I think.  In some
other minds, too, I understand.  But it was explicitly disallowed by
some other (Nantucket) minds.  Awkward point that.  I still say
Harbour can be different, but I also say I don't think it should be
different by default.

Have you yet noticed that we're both making the same point time and
time again?  I've asked we stop.  I intend to.  But I really disagree
if you force your behaviour to be enabled by default.  Please let's
at least vote.

You're making a lot of assumptions about the code in Clipper.  You

The macro compiler wouldn't be seeing an ambiguity.  It would
presumably have a single view of what the expression meant.  Clipper
behaves like that.  The macro compiler might've looked at every macro
and if it were a list it could've treated it as a series of comma
operators, evaluating each expression and discarding all but the
last result.  Probably easy to do, but not what Clipper does.  We
don't know why.  You've tried to guess.  I may guess differently. :-)

My suggested way would actually be more consistent.  A list in a macro
would always be evaluated left to right, discarding each result but
the last.  No need to care what surrounding context was outside the
macro.  Very simple, very clean.  Not the same as what you want.

Harbour users.  Or a vote of developers.  Or - well, something more
than just doing it unilaterally in the face of dissention (sp?).
That's not how I understood Harbour was being developed.

In what way?  If the decision goes against what I vote for, I'll
accept it.  I hope you'd do the same.  I'm not accusing you of being
self serving.

I'm happy to have a vote or votes on those.  Probably a good idea.
In what way is voting objective or not objective and why do you raise

Then if Harbour is to be dBase compatible that's what it should do.

It conflicts with what Clipper does, so it should not be the default.

With that background, and aiming for dBase compatibility, it's clear
how it should be handled.  With a different background, it can have
a different meaning (func. with one param).  With Clipper that macro's
not allowed, so for a Clipper-compatible system to allow it is an
addition.  It's ambiguous in the sense that there are two different
ways it could be added.

I was hoping for a response along the lines of "yes there are two but
actually we should pick <whichever> because <reason> (e.g. because
that's what a Clipper developer would expect)".  Your response based
on dBase may be what most Clipper developers would say (I don't know,
but it seems plausible).

Right.  I don't think I've followed why you wanted to highlight that.

> | But a code block isn't a code substitution mechanism is it?

Depends a bit what one means by "substitution" (please don't mention
Slick Willy!).  "Parameterisation" is perhaps more what a code block
could be described as, but then we're into trying to figure out what
exactly the difference is between substitution and parameterisation,
and what a macro's for.  Hmm... one even should distinguish between
a macro's usage (&something) and its "creation" (better word?), i.e.
the "something".  Similarly we've the creation of the code block
(starts with "{|", continues to the closing "}") and its usage
(EVAL(...)).  Common usage (Clipper programmerese?) seems to be rather
careless (imprecise) about macros, frequently not distinguishing
between the something (a string) and the usage of the macro operator
(&).  I'm probably guilty of such imprecision; is it what made you
bring up lambda & eval?

:-(

> What does "being a compiler" tell us?

Commonly, that it's not an interpreter.  Normally a compiler is rather
different from an interpreter, including what happens at runtime.  Now
with a background in (interpretive) dBase one may well want only some
of the typical features of a compiler (object files, LIBs, whatever).
One may or may not want the other common feature: that the runtime is
less dynamic than with an interpreter.  Commonly you don't get a
choice :-(, i.e. you get whatever the runtime does.  I guess that's
about the position with Clipper.

Many/most compiled environments would not be willing to regard
SomeFunc( &cMacro ) as anything but a function with a single param,
and Clipper pretty much is that way.  I'm not arguing that Clipper is
right or that in the context of a dBase background that
SomeFunc( &cMacro ) should be regarded as a func. with a single param,
but I am saying that commonly it would be taken as that.  There are
exceptions and from a dBase POV Harbour would be an exception.  From
a Clipper POV presumably Harbour would do what Clipper does. :-)

With a dBase POV, so would I.  Actually, I would from a Clipper POV
in the sense that it checks the result of the macro operation to make
sure it's not a list, then throw an error if it is.

I meant that instead of doing
  SomeFunc( &cMacro )
one could do
  &("SomeFunc(" + cMacro + ")" )
if I got the syntax right.  SomeFunc() now can't be a static, which
may be a nuisance.

Quite.  But this feature _is_ enabled by default. :-(

I'm still confused. The above could easily describe problems with logic
shortcutting. Perhaps I'm still very confused about this business of there
been a compile time setting and a runtime setting. I'm not at all sure I
understand it.

That isn't, as we both know, the goal of harbour. Neither is it the
suggestion I'm making.

I think I've said a few times now that I'm not arguing in favour of default
behaviour. But, in case it still isn't clear:

o I am not suggesting that this is good default behaviour.

o I am suggesting that macro expansion of a list within a function argument
  context should probably result in "N" arguments resulting, not one
  argument (assuming that such a enhancement is a good idea).

Nothing more, nothing less.

We're going over old ground again. You don't need to tell me that it is
ambiguous, it is obvious in the extreme that it is ambiguous. I'm not
interesting in being told that it is ambiguous because if it wasn't we
wouldn't be debating the pros and cons of the possible interpretations.

In a nutshell: I'm documenting some reasoning for one interpretation. You've
said you disagree with it. I've asked why and you've told me that there is
some ambiguity. I already knew that.

IOW I gave you the response you desired a couple or so days ago? I outlined
how I would personally expect such an extension to work and I detailed the
reasons why I have such an expectation.

I think so. What I was trying to highlight is that a code block is a body of
compiled code, you can pass it around as such and it can and does carry some
detail about the environment in which it was instantiated (think lambda in
lisp). You can't, however, pass around a "macro" because there's no such
thing. There's only macro expansion/evaluation (that slash is there to point
out that there is obviously two modes of viewing macro "invocation").

At no point should anyone see a code block as something that is in any way
expanded, unlike a macro expanded/evaluated string.

I take it that we'd agree that Clipper is more like an interpreter than it
is like a "true" compiler? Moreover, many interpreters are compilers anyway.

I was thinking about this this morning and I think the problem here might
well be that macro expansion/evaluation is done using an operator instead of
a function. For example, assume we had no "&" but instead had a function:

,----
| cMacro := "1, 2, 3"
| SomeFunc( MacroEval( cMacro ) )
`----

I'd expect the macro eval function to throw an error because cMacro doesn't
contain a valid like of Clipper code.

Point being, I think we're in agreement that it really all depends on if you
see this:

,----
| cMacro := "1, 2, 3"
| SomeFunc( &cMacro )
`----

as something employing macro expansion or macro evaluation (Clipper calls
the operator the macro evaluation operator IIRC so there's some scope for
backing up your interpretation there). If someone views the above as macro
*expansion* then it seems only sensible that they see a function being
passed three arguments. If, on the other hand, they see the above as macro
*evaluation* they should probably expect it to throw an error.

Right, I'm with you, there are alternative methods.

  The ambiguity appears if you look inside a Foo function. See the 
example:

cMacro :="DBSEEK(somwhere),FOUND()"
Foo( &cMacro )

FUNCTION Foo( lSomeFlag, lZAPdatabase )

  IF( lZAPdatabase )
   .....

  The other ambiguity is caused that in Clipper all expressions returns a 
single value. You seems to see the macro opertor as a text substitution 
method however there is, IMHO, a clear separation beetwen a text 
substitution:
cVar := "&somevar.sometext"
and a macro operator
&cMacro
  So far all operators are working on valid expressions - the comma 
separated list not enclosed in perens is not a valid Clipper expression.

  The ambiguity appears also in more complex expressions:
cMacro := "1,2,3"
Foo( &cMacro+4 )

  What parameters should be expected in Foo function? (1,2,3) or a 
runtime error or - and why not - (1,2,7). Why &macro is only limited to a 
standalone expression?

  I disagree. A macro operator is compiling and evaluating a valid 
expression. Comma separated list is not a valid expression in Clipper.

  Unfortunatelly, the macro list support is enabled by default due to 
Ron's request.

  Because codeblock is an encapsulated list of expressions to evaluate.

  Yes, there is no ambiguity however there is no list of expressions 
here. There is a list of array elements. This is a big difference that 
you are ignoring here. Every expresion on the array list should return a 
single value. In other case allowing to support "1,2,3" here will cause 
ambiguity because you will never determine the size of the array without 
checking the value of 'macro'

  Ron, '{}' operators are not the same as '()' parens. The literal array 
is not a list of expressions - it is a literal array.

  Because most incompatibilities are safe. Valid code will still work the 
same. With the new macro list some valid code will be broken. This is the 
reason why it should be disabled by default.

Well, for my $0.02, I fully agree. Never really liked the & operator anyway,
but I would always expect the program to behave as if whatever the macro
contains had been typed in at that point in the source.

You guys ever considered the legal profession? I reckon a lot of barristers
would have dropped out by now :)

That's fine, the only thing I'm puzzled by, and take offense to, is your
claim that I'm forcing my opinion - why would you do that?

I've contributed code, which I found useful, its my understanding that
anyone is encouraged to do so. I didn't hide the reason/logic behind such
contribution. I have willingly participated in a meaningful, objective
debate on the issue. I never hinted I'll not accept a group decision or
anything of the like. Why would you paint me as forcing my opinion on this
project? Should I claim you are trying to force your opinion just because
you are requesting the removal or default disabling of this feature?

"Forcing" is a very strong word, with a much different context, in my point
of view.

BTW, I'm not going to further respond to your recent replies, because I feel
we covered the same ground many times already. I'm just surprised you didn't
respond to my defense to your claim of the list extension breaking code, and
most specifically breaking the LIST command. For the benefit of my curiosity
I will post my it as a public survey, both here and on the Clipper list.

Thank you for all your input.

Ron

I'm well aware of *where* the ambiguity arises, this should be obvious from
the context of the discussion and the content of my question. The above code
you've given as an example says nothing more, or less, than the little
example that you replied to (and I've snipped for the sake of brevity).

I'm puzzled by your response here because I can't see the cause of the
ambiguity in it, only the location of it.

Agreed, there is some distinction. What I'm saying, however, is that there
is some scope for this distinction being blurred. In the case of a list
being macro expanded in a function argument list context it seems to me that
the two possibly valid interpretations are a) it expands to an argument list
(yes, even splicing into an existing argument list) or b) it's an error
because "1, 2, 3" isn't really valid Clipper code.

>   So far all operators are working on valid expressions - the comma
> separated list not enclosed in perens is not a valid Clipper expression.

Agreed. In case it isn't clear (and I'll admit that my point is a little
stretched out over a few emails), what I'm saying is:

,----
| cMacro := "1, 2, 3"
| Foo( &cMacro )
`----

should, ideally, throw an error because the content of cMacro isn't valid
Clipper code. However, if it is decided that it shouldn't throw an error
(which is where I think we're at right now, right?) I'm suggesting that it
should be seen as a list of three arguments because it can't possibly be
seen as a list expression that would yield one argument.

I'd expect either a runtime error because "1, 2, 3" isn't valid Clipper code
or, failing that "Foo( 1, 2, 3+4 )".

Agreed. I've never been attempting to address the issue of the validity of
the macro expansion/evaluation of an "unguarded" list, what I have been
attempting to address is John's suggestion that this:

,----
| cMacro := "1, 2, 3"
| Foo( &cMacro )
`----

should result in FOO() being called with one argument. All I'm suggesting is
that, if it doesn't simply result in a runtime error because the content of
cMacro is invalid code (I think this is the better option) it should ideally
result in a function call with three arguments.

Agreed, I think it is unfortunate too. If such a feature is to be considered
as an enhancement it should ideally be off by default (see my initial
concerns about this from 2001-07-18. The pointers are still on the harbour
news page.

Dear Harbour users,

I will greatly appreciate it, if you can take a minute of your time to
answer 2 of the following 3, multiple choice, simple questions:

Given the following code:

    cFields := "FIELD->First, FIELD->Last, FIELD->Age"

    USE TEST
    LIST OFF &cFields WHILE RecNo() == 1

1. What do you *believe* Clipper behavior should be - *if* it was up to you?

   a. R/T Error, because Clipper does not support macros of list as per
Clipper documentation.


   b. Display as follows:

            91

      because LIST arguments are implemented by means of codeblocks, which
although
      are not documented to support macros of list, in effect do, and since
lists
      in block will evaluate all expressions, but only produce the last
value, thus
      output of above code should only display the value of FIELD->Age.

   c. Display as follows:

      Hommer     Simpson             91

      because this is what my code intended to do, that's how it worked in
my previous
      Clipper versions, and that's how it worked in dBase, before I upgraded
to Clipper.

2. What do you *think* Clipper actually does (same choices as above)?
   Please answer *only* if you don't know for sure, and haven't run the
code.

3. What do you believe you *know* Clipper behavior to be (same choices as
above)?
   Please answer *only* if you knew the answer *before* recent discussion on
this list.

* Please note you should only answer questions 1 and, 2 *or* 3.

TIA

Ron

1 c
3 b

However.

IMHO - I believe this should be handled by adding a different or modified
match marker, not by modifying the 'default' operation of the  macro
processor to occasionally deal with 'lists'.  That way, the resulting
side-effects are (hopefully) reduced.  (No I have not given this a lot of
thought)  ie: LIST ~Fields

I am somewhat curious how the other xbase dialects handle this?  (Flagship,
Xbase, etc)

Aside from the time required, there must have been some reason nantucket did
what they did.

It makes no difference what anybody thinks about how it should work if
it didn't work the way it actually works. It works the way it works and

I'm working with Borland C++ 5.51 and Harbour related binaries.
My idea is to use Blinker to link obj generated, because in the past I was
always satisfied of Blinker.
Now I get a memory over 64K error.
There are some particulary setup to use Blinker as linker for Harbour ?

Thanks

Actualy, you don't need Blinker to link your application. If you have
Borland 5.5.1 you already have a linker.

Yes, included in the Borland package there is ILINK32, but I suppose that
Blinker was better ... I'm in error ? :)

Unfortunately, Blinker does nor support Harbour. 

Ilink32 provides incremental linking, so you have
a real fast linking process. And all for free :-)

Ok, I need to abandone it :) It was my friend for a lot of year ;)

You are right ! :)
The next step for me is now to rewrite all blinker linkage files, to convert
to ilink response file.

Ron:

I wouldn't write that code, and therefore have not contemplated what
it should do if I did.  I find it irrelevant how many people would
guess one way or the other what Clipper would do as if that should
dictate Harbour behavior.
My only contribution to the discussion is
that, by default, Harbour should compile and run existing Clipper code
with the same results as Clipper 5.2 or 5.3.  Extensions and
improvements are great, and I'll probably turn them all on, but
existing code should not break at all with default settings for
Harbour.  That part is that simple.
I won't even try to apply it to the current macro issue, other than to
recommend what I see as the guiding prime directive:
existing code should not break at all with default settings for Harbour.

Please, if you send a file, ZIP it.

I use the new Outlook XP and it does NOT accept .BAT files. It just
removes the file from the mail. There is NO way to setup Outlook so that
it accepts that kind of files.
It also does not accept: .EXE, .HLP, .COM, .INF,.. Actualy, any file
extention that can "run" code.

Thanks! ;-)

Patrick,

Take a look at this page. It contains a zip file, which adds an option
to outlook to take files off the unsafe list. Works well.

[I notice from harbour-talk that it is "hypocrisy"] I've never noticed that
hypocrisy is a key attribute of people who care about a language and want to
be totally sure about making the right decisions, even if the debate is a
little protracted.

Feel free to show us where we're going wrong, I'm sure the input will be
very valuable.

Not at compile-time (which was what I meant).  At runtime, I mentioned
I use hardly any macros so it doesn't matter to me. ;-)  It does
matter for Harbour to be the same as Clipper, however, whatever way
Clipper behaves.

Pity you didn't ask whether the macro extensions feature should be

I've tried to explain the why someone might prefer the other meaning
of a list macro: that Clipper is a compiler and the more one considers
it a compiler and less an interpreter then the more likely one would
go for the dBase way of handling a list macro.  (Just putting this in
to complete the context - I see you're aware of this. :-)

Right.  I'm guessing that was what you were getting at when you used
the word "substitution".  My concern at that was with the fine detail
of just what is meant.  Ah, reading on I see more from you in a
moment...

> I take it that we'd agree that Clipper is more like an interpreter than=

Yes.

> Moreover, many interpreters are compilers anyway.

Yes.  Clipper's in some ways a "fake" compiler in that it
(deliberately) makes OBJ files containing pcode.  For good reasons,
but it sort of "misled" some people who were then rather surprised
when things such as Valkyrie & Rescue appeared.

It's where and why Clipper and its macro feature are positioned on
this compiler-interpreter spectrum that may help decide whether a list
in a macro should be allowed and what it should mean.  I don't seem
to have convinced Ron that this even _is_ an issue. :-(  Whereas, I
understand your position. :-)

Apart from wanting Harbour Clipper-compatible by default, I'm not
entirely sure what my position is about what a list macro should do
when enabled.  Something sane/clean, properly doc'ed, etc. :-)

> I think the problem here might well be that macro expansion/evaluation
> is done using an operator instead of a function

Maybe.  I do agree that if it were a function (your example below)
> | cMacro :=3D "1, 2, 3"
> | SomeFunc( MacroEval( cMacro ) )
then a list in a macro should probably not be seen as 3 params.

> I think we're in agreement that it really all depends on if you

> as something employing macro expansion or macro evaluation

Yes.  On the understanding that "expansion" is intended to mean (as I
believe you do mean) that it's akin to re-writing the source code,
then compiling the part concerned _including_ the surrounding context
(the SomeFunc() here).  It looks a workable and useful extension, if
it is meant to (and does!) work like that.  The C Standard defines
some things as needing to work "as if" done in a certain way.  Maybe
in Harbour "&" could be defined to be like Clipper by default but when
macro extensions are enabled it changes to being as if this kind of
text substitution were done.  Hmm... not quite, as then:
  LOCAL x :=3D 1
  cMacro :=3D "x"
  SomeFunc( &cMacro )
would be allowed.

I suppose this kind of trouble is the result of an attempt to be
interpreter and compiler.  It doesn't make an exact definition of "&"
any easier, though.

> (Clipper calls the operator the macro evaluation operator IIRC so
> there's some scope for backing up your interpretation there).

Sort of, though the Clipper doc. doesn't exactly define "evaluation"
fully. :-(

Or that it should be like a code block, i.e. the commas are operators
which evaluate their left arg, discard the result, then evaluate the
right arg.  As Ryszard says, this would then mean that "&" was like
other operators in that it would produce a single value.  It feels a
bit non-dBase, though.

Because you've enabled this feature by default.  That's not what

compatible.

You could claim it but it would be contrary to the stated aim of the
Harbour project.

True.  Unilaterally overriding the stated aims of the Harbour project
can merit it.

We've gone round in circles on that.  I say it's ambigous, Dave says

John numerous macro extensions that are non Clipper compatible are enabled
by default, and were enabled since the time the macro compiler was
developed. You claim that adding the list extension, I should have treated
it differently, or else I'm forcing my opinion? Why?

> > "Forcing" is a very strong word

I think you know better then to paint it this way. The list extension is
*negligible* when compared to the other non Clipper compatible macro
extensions - all enabled by default.

To say that I'm disappointed with your offensive and unwarranted attitude
will be an under statement.

Eh? Where does the eval stack come into this? The above URL points to a
harbour news article that reports me wondering if a side effect of list
expansion might be considered a bug. As far as I can tell the issue still
stands (in so much as nothing has changed and there's nothing about eval
stacks involved).

<URL:http://www.matrixlist.com/pipermail/harbour/2001-July/007413.html> is
the email that the about harbour news URL points to.

Another useful way of looking at it (to see where I'm coming from) is to see
a "splicing" operation happening at runtime (I hesitate to mention ",@" in
Lisp back-tick expansion but if you recognise it you'll know what I mean).

1. c

don't see the point in being compatible with Clipper in generating run-time
errors for macro cases that Clipper doesn't handle. Why would existing
Clipper code have such statements? The only argument for this would be that
you don't want things that work in Harbour, but then don't work in Clipper
(5.x) ..  Maybe throw a warning.

This was reviewed many months ago, but I hope an silly solution based in
Clipper compatibility

I have many Clipper programs using DBSELECTAR( x ), and compile/link/run in
Clipper without problems

When I try in Harbour,  can not link because " Unresolved external
'_HB_FUN_DBSELECTAR' ", so I must change to DBSELECTAREA( x ) in order to
link. 

There are many programs to change
I think if DBSELECTAR(x) work with Clipper, should work with Harbour
without changes

The same happen with DBCLEARREL

And EVENTMASK is not recognized too

It was decided, in the early days of harbour, that we wouldn't be bug
compatible with CA-Clipper where fixing the bug wouldn't impact on harbour
users.

There's little point in being exactly bug-compatible.

I think best thing to do is to replace all DBSELECTAR in all files, with a
utility, but I have solved with a little support function:

function DBSELECTAR (xParameter)
return (DBSelectArea (xParameter))

You can do the same for the other truncated function.

It is not the best solution, but it work :)

I followed the URL and clicked on the article that seemed appropriate.
IAC, the posting of mine you replied to wasn't about any side effect
of list expansion; any such would be in addition to what I posted.

I don't agree.  I also don't see why the other extensions are on by

Whatever it's called, the effect should be explained in some detail,
I suppose under the "&" doc.  Enough detail that any able developer
can correctly predict the outcome of an expression which uses "&"
(whether once or multiple times).

I don't think Lisp had it way-back-when.  Or I just forgot. :-(
Sounds like sh's (bash's) back quote (`expr`).  The nice thing about
(Bourne's) sh was that the doc made clear what would happen. :-)

  Ron, just show also different usage to get clear view on the issue:

cFields :="othertest->(DBSEEK(test->First)),othertest->otherField"
USE OTHERTEST
USE TEST
LIST &macro
LIST test->last,&macro

Obviously, submitting patches that fix perceived problems with harbour's
documentation is highly encouraged.

I don't recall a vote being taken, it was more a matter of consensus. There
was some discussion about if some of the useful operators that CA-Clipper
doesn't allow in a macro should be allowed in harbour and nobody, that I can
recall, had any objections.

I am not intending to waste your/anybodies time reopenning discussion,
but expect to find (somewhere in the future) documented such "not bug-com=
patiblies";
sometimes is small distiction between bugs and features;
on Clipper some bug/behaviour could trigger error and branch program flow
on some other way then it happens in "bugless" environment, so you
experience different (sometimes hard to detect why) result

of course, application programmer is responsable for everything happening=
 in
his product (not the program tool developper), but it is superb feeling =
just
recompile/relink with new powerfull tool and EVERYTHING works at once!

You mentioned how list expansion support could change the way a program
works, the URL <URL:http://www.davep.org/harbour/news/?show=20010718092356>
I supplied was pointing you to an email exchange I'd had with Ron on that
subject. I was illustrating that I shared your concern.

I'm still not sure where the "eval stack" comes into this.

How could it be a surprise? I mentioned it NUMEROUS times over these past
few days! Could it be that you argued without properly reading the posts you
argue against?

> Was a vote taken?  If not, who enabled them by default?

No Vote was not taken, and it was implemented by Ryszard. It's my guess that
had a vote been taken, it would have been approved, because many times it
was said that we do NOT have to be 100% ERROR COMPATIBLE with Clipper.

Ok. :-(

What don't you agree with?

The macro list expression support, is a separate issue from __dbList()
optimization, and will NEVER effect any code, other than code that raises a
Clipper ERROR!!!

If you dispute this, you will have to PROVE this with a code sample, that
runs in Clipper WITHOUT raising an ERROR, and yet is producing different
results in Harbour (related to list macro).

You are UNABLE to produce such sample code, because in Clipper ALL macros of
lists, generate an ERROR with the exception of when inside CodeBlocks, and
the list macro extension, does NOT affect lists in CodeBlocks!!!

Thus, the list support is only ERROR INCOMPATIBLE, exactly like:

   Var++
   ++Var
   Var--
   --Var
   Var += ...
   Var -= ...
   Var *= ...
   Var /= ...
   Var %= ...
   Var ^= ...
   Nested blocks, And many others.

If you dispute it being negligible, in light of the above all being
supported, please explain. Remember it does NOT affect any VALID Clipper
code!!!

Let's not go in circles John, you know I'm offended by your claim that I'm
forcing my opinion on this project. It is offensive because it's FALSE! The
group has accepted, and supported, enhancements that are ERROR INCOMPATIBLE
with Clipper, long before you joined. Before deciding that I'm forcing my
opinion, you should have known your facts better, rather than hide behind:

   "That comes as a surprise to me."

BTW, just recently I implemented an extension to accommodate *your* need, in
that case you said:

   "Much better idea. :-)  It was really needed in Clipper but never added."

I wonder how would you have argued against someone objecting the
enhancement, claiming that it was not implemented by Nantucket for a GOOD
reason???

You are 100% correct, I'm sorry for delaying Harbour. I have wasted too much
time here. I'm happy to announce that I'll no longer take any role in this
project.

Phil/Dave could you please remove my developer account, as I'll not be
needing it any longer.

  OK, all is clear now. I agree also that the runtime error should be the 
default behaviour because we havealready (as John pointed) support for 
such functionality (although with some limitations):

dummyVar :=&( "Foo(&cMacro)" )
or
dummyVar :=&( "Foo("+cMacro+")" )

 Luiz,
 

LRCG> btw did you compiled with /DCAAD and /DANIRO.

 Yes, now I got it.
 This is caused by the presence of commands ( not pp directives ) in
 #include files. But this isn't pp error - these lines are
 preprocessed correctly:

 ...
         Scroll(06,01,20,78 ) ; SetPos(06,01 )
#line 1 "TTTTTF.CH"
         IF menu0000=1
#line 1 "GA.CH"
GA0000()
#line 3 "TTTTTF.CH"
         ELSEIF menu0000=2
...

   Compiler doesn't accept this. Ryszard ?

I'm going to echo what Antonio's written in the past.  There are people
who talk and there are people who help.  Let's not attack the people
who help.

Ron,

I do not agree.

You're the most contributor in a real sense in form of *codes* not
*talks* nor *argue*. If you leave, this will be the end.

We can't remove your SourceForge account, that's not under our control
(assuming that's what you meant). If you're asking that one of us remove
your rights as a harbour developer, well, what can I say, personally I've
think that's a little rash.

I'll leave it up to one of the other admins.

I believe that, wherever possible, such differences are documented in the
harbour documentation. If you've found any harbour documentation that
doesn't document some intentional difference you're encouraged to submit a
fix.

Not that it detracts from your point, but, I think it's worth pointing out
that valid Clipper code can and does raise errors. Raising an error does not
equal invalid code.

Ron,

Some bad day (or week ?). Could arrive to anyone, trust me ! ;-))) 

I don't think this is the best decision you can take here. You know, 
(as most/all of us) you are a good and very inventive programmer. 
And ... Yes as many inventors you are not always followed by 
most of us, including me. This is a good thinks. Nothing can be 
invented without discussion (and even a bit figthing).

I'm fighting with my ::Super(...) problem for weeks now, but I'm sure 
I will find a solution, one day of another just because I continue to 
try as many solution I can invent.

This is the same with you current discussion, stay and there will 
be something new and better within Harbour, just because you will 
be forced to think and rethink. If you leave now, because someone 
said something you dislike,  you'll lose as does Harbour.

In all case, this is your decision, take one week hollidays and 
rethink it.

Friendly,

Best regards,

J. Lefebvre,
Bruxelles,
Belgium

 SET EVENTMASK
 Specify events to be returned by the INKEY() function
--------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax

     SET EVENTMASK TO <nEventMask>

 Arguments

     <nEventMask> specifies which events should be returned by the
     INKEY() function.  This argument can be any combination of the
following
     values which are defined in Inkey.ch:

     Inkey Constants
--------------------------------------------------------
     Constant       Value     Description
--------------------------------------------------------
      INKEY_MOVE     1         Mouse Events
     INKEY_LDOWN    2         Mouse Left Click Down
     INKEY_LUP      4         Mouse Left Click Up
     INKEY_RDOWN    8         Mouse Right Click Down
     INKEY_RUP      16        Mouse Right Click Up
     INKEY_KEYBOARD 128       Keyboard Events
     INKEY_ALL      159       All Mouse and Keyboard Events
--------------------------------------------------------

     If a value is not specified for SET EVENTMASK, the default value of 128
     (keyboard events only) will be used.

 Description

     The SET EVENTMASK command specifies which events should be returned by
     the INKEY() function.  Using this mask you can have INKEY() return only
     the events in which you are interested.

 Example

     The following example will inform INKEY() to terminate if a keyboard
     event occurs or the left mouse button has been clicked.  If no events
     occur within 5 seconds, INKEY() will terminate.

        SET EVENTMASK TO INKEY_KEYBOARD + INKEY_LDOWN
        ? INKEY( 5 )

I complained to SourceForge about the "chgrp: getting attributes of
`/cvsroot/Harbour-project': No such file or directory" error that we
were always getting and they fixed the problem on Tue, 14 Aug 2001. (I
didn't notice this until I did a CVS commit today and saw no error,
because it appears that I forgot to ask for email notification.)

> SET EVENTMASK

One down, two to go.

One possibility to add default preprocessor translations for DBSELECTAR
to DBSELECTAREA and for DBCLEARREL to DBCLEARRELATION. Which brings up
two other points: 1) Would translations also be needed for DBSELECTARE,
DBCLEARERELA, DBCLEARRELAT, DBCLEARRELATI, and DBCLEARRELATIO? 2) Are
there any other Clipper built-in function names that exceed 10
characters?

Added conditional functionality for MS C compiler to use io and conio libs
to map stdin in the same manner as already implemented for unix version
(i.e. no blocking).

That is, if stdin is coming from console, inkey() returns 0 if no key
waiting, and if stdin is coming from a file, inkey() returns each char of
file and then always returns 0 once EOF is reached.

David,

> 1) Would translations also be needed for DBSELECTARE,

DBCLEARRELA, DBCLEARRELAT, DBCLEARRELATI, and DBCLEARRELATIO?

These would all map to "DBCLEARREL", which in-turn could map to the (> 10
char) internal "HB_" function name.
( AFAIK this is how CA-Clipper treats "library" function names / handles
this item. )

>2) Are there any other Clipper built-in function names that exceed 10
characters?
A representative 5.3 list follows..  It may be incomplete, though.

Regards,
Bob

Not the same situation as with list macros, then.

I have to say I think it may have been written in haste, I think by
someone who doesn't have English as a first language.  Even if my

not my view.

I don't see it as wasted time.  (OK, some of it may be, but most is
not.)

Quite difficult in the absence of knowing how a feature should/does
work, especially as regards compatibility issues (whether minor or
not).

Sure.  It surprised me.

That's always a possibility, though I try to read with care.  It
doesn't apply in this case.  As I've said, I wanted to stick to the
specific new list macro feature.

But in some cases these extensions prevent being compatible with
Clipper in other cases.  It may well be that people are on the whole
happy with that but it bears thinking about.

As to whether it's negligible.

As has been said (by Dave IIRC), it can be valid in a Clipper app to
raise errors, catch them, and continue.  That was the situation in the
example I posted.

It's also the case for the LIST command (as Ryszard posted).

I don't mean to offend.  However, adding a feature that's not
compatible with Clipper and enabling it by default without any vote
or consensus is a form of forcing.

> The group has accepted, and supported, enhancements that are ERROR
> INCOMPATIBLE with Clipper

Right.  But this current feature doesn't appear to fit that
description.

I guess you mean during the time when I wasn't subscribed.  I found
I couldn't cope with the volume on top of my other commitments.  That
still occurs. :-(

Yes.  It can't AFAIK break any existing code because it's an extra PP
marker and clipper.exe would just issue an error message.

I'd have asked what problem(s) it could add.  Then taken it from there.

BTW, I'm happy for that debate at any future time - the marker can be
disabled by default without bothering me. :-)  It's presence actually
covers up that the Harbour PP behaves a little differently than
Clipper, which is not ideal.  OTOH, the difference is pretty obscure
and the extra marker let me re-write PP things in a way I'd have
preferred if Clipper had allowed it.  Fine by me, but it's true that
someone could object (now or later).  I think we should start a new
thread if this really is an issue.

It's not that hard. If someone cares and is interested they can always ask
on this list, or ask the author of the code in question directly. It's
worked for me before (not updating docs, but checking my assumptions about a
body of code).

What sort of licence will you be making this library available under? Are
you intending to use some sort of free software or OpenSource licence or
will this be non-free software?

It has been pointed out to me that the "problem" with function
identifiers that are longer than 10 characters is a "known problem" that
has two existing solutions:

1) Build Harbour with HB_C52_STRICT set.
2) Build Harbour with HB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN set to 10.

And that adding all those extra mappings to Harbour would be a wrong
solution. However, if somebody wants to add a contrib module (or series
of modules) that map the 10 to actual length - 1 variations to the
appropriate long function names (either as functions or as
translations), then that would be fine.

 It will be free, with sources available, with possibility to use it
 in commercial applications( with mention of this library and its
 author, or authors, if there will be other participants ). The only thing that I want to prevent -
 is using its code in other libraries without my permission.
 Can I write the license text in few simple sentences, without using
 some standard types of license ?

Thanks for the info. I take it that when you say it will be free you mean
free of cost, not free as in the FSF's definition of free?

Note that this does mean that the library won't be free software. Free
software would allow this (see harbour's libraries for example). Actually, I
suspect that such a requirement would meant hat it doesn't qualify as Open
Source software either (see item three of the Open Source Definition
<URL:http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html>).

Not that this is a problem or anything, I just thought I'd point it out in
case you did want to be at least OSD compliant.

>              Can I write the license text in few simple sentences, without

Possibly, depending on what you want to say. You're the copyright holder of
the code so you can write any licence you wish.

But I have a problem : how can I specify the first procedure (the main) of

There is another way to set initial procedure ?

      from console, inkey() returns 0 if no key waiting, and if stdin is
      coming from a file, inkey() returns each char of file and then
      always returns 0 once EOF is reached.

There is a problem with end-of-line wrapping. If you subtract out the
"> " below, then you have the output that I got with RSXNT with GTSTD, which inserted a blank line when wrapping the long string. (I copied gtstdtst.prg to another file and then stripped out everything but the code for this test, to confirm that the problem isn't an end-of-page problem).

I don't know much about Harbour... but when I evaluated it I used the
bld_b32.bat file in the bcc32\bin directory.  Hope it helps!

First, thanks to David G. Holm and Robert Haley, who are trying to fix
EVENTMASK, DBSELECTAR(), DBCLEARREL() and others things that I requested to
acommodate Harbour, without "talking" unnecesarily

Next, an reply to  "Mark W. Schumann", which seem to be who less understand
the sense of my messages, and he could not see behind the "talks" the
"help" to improve Harbour and disolve an another bad Harbour's time.
Obviously the group can return to those days of "Crew photos", "Harbour
T-Shirts", voting and friendly cooperation, and not merged in disputes. As
LInares said: "hipocresia" in now common, and many see that, but ignore to
take actions. Who are within the confution, not can see this confution

To John Skelton: You are right, English is not my first language and is
evident. The only of my English learning was in Secondary School (age
11-13) and most of us have troubles to express ideas in the language of
"The Land of Free", who have many walls build between US and Mexico and
consider others cultures as childs of an "Minor God". (Eso lo resume bien
una vieja cancion de Mecano)

Mi idioma es el castellano, la lengua de Cervantes, Sor Juana Ines de la
Cruz, Garcia Marquez, Octavio Paz y muchos otros que han mostrado que este
lenguaje es una delicia para hablarlo y escucharlo. Como ejemplos estan las
prosas y las metricas castellanas usadas en la enorme variedad de estilos
poeticos, su manejo de tiempos, etc. En fin, un lenguaje muy vasto. Eso me
hace sentirme muy ufano y satisfecho de usar y entender el castellano
Sadly, we have to translate ideas in a poor way to an poor and short
language as English. Is an practical, but short language who limits the
significance of many ideas

And now, Ron, again Ron, he is the center of attention again. In the list
of endless discussions I forget "Strong typing" and "lower file extensions"

About Ron, do not take care in excess, the menace to leave is just one more
of his typical behaviour
When I see his message, I thinked "yes, is a good movement (for him), wait
a little time to see the reactions". And the reactions were as he and I
expected, as in other Ron's menaces: an massive and strong support that
make forget the causes and let do what he is proposing
This was one of his most short messages, but with more impact, as he expected

Here in my place is what we call "an inverse psychology movement" (un
movimiento de psicologia inversa), which consist in simulate something to
cause exactly the opposite. In other words, menace suicide to get something
O en castellano: amenaza de suicidio para lograr un capricho

This is an typical movement and Ron has used it others times. Other time he
offered: "someone remove my access to CVS and someone include my work only
after has reviewed it". Of course, that was discarted

This movement cause an "common enemy" (even imaginary) and an strong
support, as we expected. Even Antonio Linares, who "think" to "hate" Ron,
react "protecting" (?) him. Protecting of what, or who ? Yes, does not
exist "the enemy", is just suggested and "clearly founded" by someone, but
this causes that many people forget the reasons of my messages

If the decision of Ron is formal, he can do it, without trying to involve
others, as he tryied. Does not need to be "removed", just not continue
accesing, but simulate the need "of removing for someone else", letting
them the "dirty job". Obviously, no one want to do this dirty job, as he
know. This is hipocresy

So, Ron, my friend, take it easy and let it be. Relax. Many places, and
even your home, are proper to rest, as in examples Puerto Vallarta, Cancun,
Acapulco, Puerto Angel, (we are now in Summer, as you) ... even Spain and
Brasil are good places

As all can see in my messages, no one even suggest that Ron need to be
removed, just he used this excuse
In his "closed mind", "hard head", or as you can name it, he only want see:
"Yes or Not", "All or Nothing", "Full or Empty", "Strong typing or bad
Harbour",  "Simplex or bad Harbour", "Macro expansions or bad Harbour", and
so on, as result, endless discussions that delay all the group, and at
last, his code in his way in Harbour: For those who does not want to see
it, this is "forcing" and some else like it

This is an very simple way of life, and very easily to live: just one of
two ways, and as result only my way. Is not bad, but affect others oftenly

As Ron and we know, he has many options:
- Ignore his menace and continue working, (and playing, sadly), "with
Harbour group", just until now is happening, including code and "pushing"
and forcing to be accepted by the group, in his way
- Apply his menace, but remove itself (just not contributing). I do not
like that, as all we know, because an creator not must be stopped, but
sometimes need to be redirected
- Contribute, but ASK to others. This is very difficult to him, and maybe
imposible, as he think
- Contribute, but let to others include to CVS(?) his work after evaluating
- Voting (is still used ?) about the direction of the contributions
- Relax an short or medium  time, stop contributing, and just seeing how
Harbour is moving. Maybe Harbour could get more movement and Clipper
compatibility
- Continue applyng changes to Harbour, but in "your own Harbour project
that does not affect Clipper compatabilities". Yes, use Harbour core and
improve it for your own uses, where "Clipper compatibility" has not care.
Of course, this is valid, is your work. Obviously, soon or later you will
be sharing your work with others.
As examples, some use Harbour with, ADS; other with MySQL, etc, for own
uses, but no one affect Clipper compatibility
- Stop as Harbour code developer, and just use your high abilities as "beta
tester", now in Harbour tests
- Contribute with ideas, but in the Harbour group direction

As you can see, Ron, the world is not closed as you sense it and are many
options there

What is suggested is just an "little big change in your mind" that help
Harbour group in an more productive way for all. This little big changes in
mind are very easy to do, we only need to do it, just it. You, your family
and other will be glad with it (yes, I know that you are SURE that your
actual way is the only valid). As in other time, I just tell to you: think
on it

Anyway, with any decision that he choose, he will have my support, and so
maybe we will get an better "Ron Pinkas"
This is because no one have the rights to force anyone to some decision, is
his right. What we could is use our experience to help

For all of you who do not understand at first time the reasons of my
message, I include it again to let them think on it:
"Clipper users and developers want to take an Clipper native source code
file and compile and run it with Harbour, without the need of changes of
code or settings by defaults"
Some contribution of Ron, as he know but do not want to recognize in
public, affect this and delay the entire project

In other case, I am glad with the notice of  "Alexander S.Kresin", about an
"GUI library". I hope not this limited it to Win32

Sorry for my english, in Spanish I use to do it better oftenly

Gracias,
David Macias

Can you be more specific in this point. the first file that is linked in the
app before the c0w32 or c0d32 has the main procedure

I am back again after seeing an funny TV program

I see again the Ron Message again and a see something interesting. I am
trying to explain. Ron said:

including:
- "I have wasted too much time here"
- "I'm happy to announce that I'll no longer take any role in this"
trying to apparent to be someone tired of carry or stay with someone, and
happy to "fire it", just like some "heavy wife" or "boss" or "job"

I said "trying to apparent" because I do not see that Ron want to "fire
off" Harbour, in place of that, "want to leave it in an decent way", but
not founding the proper opportunity to do that, so, this time, even bad,
this is an opportunity

Any one have thinked that Ron WANT HIS TIME for something else ? and his
compromise with Harbour group is so strong to keep him on it ?
So, an opportunity like this give an gold time to do it, even in simulating
be happy to leave

We know that we all have stages in our lives, and maybe Ron see that his
stage in Harbour development can not longer be extended
Maybe he feel attraction time ago for others own or shared projects, so he
need his time and efforts for that

If this is true, I am happy for Ron. Just Ron know and can clarify this

Many of us have experienced this changes, and many of us force to cause
this changes itself, so, we undertand the individual feelings and desires.
Ron is not a boy, so his decision obviously have strong reasons and what I
can do is, as always and for everyone, expect an good luck and sucessful in
his projects

Anyway, all of you will kept in Ron an good friend outside an not an
"fighter developer" within Harbour. Thats he know. In few months he would

I am a "lurker", an experienced Clipper developer, and I have watched many
of these things go back and forth.  I have a few observations over Ron
quitting.  First, I think that most of the developers have said it
correctly, that they don't want Ron to leave.  I think that the nature of
programming in a team is that sometimes people will butt heads.  I have done
it enough, myself, and, tomorrow, I am going to a party hosted by someone
whose relationship to me could be described as "Antonio vs. Ron".  We
actually like each other.  We disagree strongly at times.  We have said
harsh things.

I think that Ron said that he was quitting, because it just isn't worth it
to him anymore to be bashed like this.  I don't think there is a game here.
Even if there is, who cares.  He contributes ( apparently ), good code.  I
think we all need to realize, including the developers, that you can have
very strong, heated opinions, but that is what it is ( and from the recent
msgs, the developers do).  I'm not saying that the person who wrote the orig
msg about Ron and his many heated battles over time with various peoples was
"completely" wrong, I'm just saying that maybe it is because he cares about
the project.  If he is difficult, well hell, we all are.

c0w32.obj is the startup, which means that is the
code that is executed just before the application
really starts, so it will _not_ replace or affect
your initial procedure.

That was exactly the meaning of my comments about hypocrisy.

We now seem a group of lawyers on a court, instead of a
group of friends. Why ? Possibly Dave pushed too much
that "legal" and "picky" style...

Ron may stay or he may leave. Harbour is matured enough
to resist that.

Firstly, thanks for the check-ins and the tests David.

I am aware of the newline in the long string.. that's actually what I was
trying to demonstrate in the test program. As I see it, it's correct
behaviour.
It's caused by the gtapi, in deference to the 80 column terminal width.

>From the point of view that gtstd is after all a video driver sub-system,
trying to have absolutely no impact on the text output I think is
probably futile. Newline characters are not directly passed from something
like a QOUT() function (a 'programmer intended' newline) to the gtstd driver
itself - instead the gtapi calls the driver to write pieces of visible text
at certain cursor positions, and requests cursor repositioning at a new
line.
The gtstd driver has to guess that a newline is required based on the cursor
repositioning requests. The same thing happens with wrapping. The gtstd
driver can't tell the difference.

At the same time, I can see the problem in the case of trying to write
unix-style command line utilities (like 'tr' for example) that should have
clean stdin/stdout redirection. That clearly will not work as there is bound
to be newlines/spaces inserted into the output stream in sympathy with the
logical cursor.

If I wanted raw stdout in Clipper, I usually wrote to the handle directly
with fwrite() or whatever. It wasn't possible via any of the standard
terminal
drivers, so from a compatibility point of view, I don't think it would be
much of an issue.

Anyway, I await comments with interest :)

Regards

Fergus

That would only make sense if you think that harbour developers are sheep
who follow me. I see no evidence of this. Are you a sheep Antonio Linares?
Do you follow me?

Dave,

> Are you a sheep Antonio Linares ?

We all have a high level of "sheep"icy inside us...

That is why we watch TV, go to the same movies,
upgrade Windows when M$ say it, have common idols,
listen to the music hits, eat and drink the same things, 
say "amen" to globalization, etc...

> Do you follow me ?

No, I don't. Personally I don't enjoy your
legal and picky style at all...

(and I don't like mini-coopers too ;-)))

I believe it is time that we all
together make an effort to build a 
Harbour to-do list to know what is 
missing to get a Harbour beta.

Any suggestions ?

You're not expected to, but I see little point in trying to make out that
your opinion of my "style" is the cause of harbour's problems.

Good job I don't own one then isn't it?

  In fact, the only missing thing is fully working RDD.
  I'm sure that if we finish, at least, DBFNTX, we could declare the
  beta stage of Harbour.
  If there are volunteers for this work, for some parts of this work,
  I'm open for any help.

Best regards,
 Alexander

David..

Please partly disregard the previous diatribe..
The blank line problem does happen in the MSDOS environment due to the auto
wrap of the console, but not under linux... I'm looking into it.

Thanks

Fergus

Yes, I think we better concentrate on a Clipper Comapitble Harbour. We
can, from there, build a better Harbour. But we need first a Clipper
compatible Harbour.

An I think we can use Ron's help! ;-)

Subject: [Harbour] compiler warnings
Message-ID: <156750301376.20010818134911@abacuslaw.com>

 The default setup for the Borland compiler yields this warning in
 Harbour api C code if a variable is initialized but then assigned a
 new value the first time it is used:
 
 Warning W8004 bitflags.c 134: 'FlagString' is assigned a value that is never used

 My C training long ago was to always initialize all values. Is this
 now out of style?  Is the appropriate fix for a clean compile:
 a) remove the initialization
 b) tell the compiler to ignore that warning
 c) live with the uncleanliness

 ??

Yes. The compiler is warning you that initialization
value never gets used, so why to do it ?

AL> Antonio
 In the good old days, the idea was that pointers (in particular)
 should always be initialized to NULL so random memory locations
 wouldn't get accessed.  It was taught as a "good habit" at least when
 starting code. Sometimes a branch in the logic gets added or removed
 that changes whether the initialized value gets used.

 In a lot of the coding i've done for Harbour, I am modifying other
 people's code more than starting any from scratch. So I hesitate to
 change code that was clearly done from one "school of thought" before
 verifying the current standards for this project.  Thanks for the
 input.

David Macias:

  You made some very important observations about Ron's interactions
  with people on this project. But you left out too many things for me
  to let you say what you did without comment.  You have grossly
  oversimplified things to imply it was all Ron's fault.
  You have no right to lay it all at his feet as if he created all
  the tense energy alone.  Surely there's a saying in Spanish similar
  to "it takes two to Tango"?

  If you want to recite all the topics of the past year that you didn't
  like reading about in the list, then your sense of philosophy should
  require you to review the ChangeLogs.  Do you have ANY idea how many
  times someone reported a problem--anywhere from a superficial bug to
  a major hole in processing--and NO ONE else responded?
  Ron fixed HUNDREDS of things for people like yourself when no one
  else would take the time to help.

  This last macro issue started as one such topic--he was "fixing" an
  issue that someone raised. OK, some other developers questioned his
  method, and he tried to explain a complex technical issue in his own
  way that is antagonistic with the other players involved.
  The fact is, if anyone else had offered that code, it would have
  been received differently. Ponder this, please.
  The fact is, Harbour is NOT error-compatible with Clipper in MANY
  places. Ron tried to explain many times that, within the macro code,
  Harbour is NOT error-compatible with Clipper because of other
  enhancements done by others.  Yet he got drilled with critiques
  because his code helping a very unusual case wasn't either.

  It is terribly unfortunate that his communication style clashed with
  others. This wasn't all his fault. It is terribly unfortunate, IMHO,
  that he couldn't ever let go of something for the sake of keeping
  the peace.  This *is* his fault -- though some see it as a virtue.

  So perhaps it is best he work independently now.  But if you are
  going to step in and write an epitaph for a man's work, you can't
  just write about the dirty laundry.  Every time you deliver an app
  using Harbour, it will be using more of his code than you know.
  Until you check those ChangeLogs.

That is a great idea!

If everybody agree, would someone please create 
such countdown_to_beta.txt (or similar name) and 
place it at the CVS ?

Thanks!

Should it not be a short filename?
Like. ToBeta.txt?

I disagree.

Patrick's tobeta.txt seems a much better name.

There will be always a to-do things list,
no matter on what stage Harbour may be...

Maybe with an reduced approach will be suffcient, and not for (length-1)
variations

If I use 
REQUEST DBRLOCKLIS, DBSETDRIV, DBSETFILTE ....
and so on (note, I use 10 characters in many of them), compiling/linking
with Harbour 0.37/OS/2/gcc/BLD.CMD I get:

e:\tcpip\tmp\cca00083: Undefined symbol _HB_FUN_DBRLOCKLIS referenced from

e:\tcpip\tmp\cca00083: Undefined symbol _HB_FUN_ORDSETRELA referenced from

e:\tcpip\tmp\cca00083: Undefined symbol _HB_FUN_ORDLISTCLE referenced from
data segment

There are many more functions with name longer than 10 char but truncated
to 10

I do not when, where and how ocurr in Clipper the truncation to 10
characters maximum in function's names

My sugest  in an intermediate point between:
>1) Build Harbour with HB_C52_STRICT set.
>2) Build Harbour with HB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN set to 10.

consisting in:
a) Apply an limit of 10 characters to all the functions which belong to
"native Clipper" (Clipper.lib, Extend.lib, Terminal.lib, Dbfntx.lib, ..... )
b) Do not apply an limit of 10 characters to all the function that does not
belong to "native Clipper", like extensions in Harbour, third party
libraries, UDF, and so on

An pseudo code can be:
- Take the name of the funcion ---> cFunc := "Function1234567890"
- Verify if this function name truncated to 10 chars belong to "native
Clipper".
  To verify this can refer to an list with functions names of "native
Clipper" limited to 10 chars
     some like:  LEFT( cFunc, 10 ) contained in list names limited to 10
chars. This make unnecesary to check for all variations for the name
     The list can be some like the "RESERVED NAMES in Clipper"
  + Yes:   Apply  an limit to 10 characters  "Function1234567890"  ->
"Function12"  truncated to 10   (cFunc:=LEFT(cFunc,10))
  + No:   Do not limit   "Function1234567890" to 10 char
- Apply reference to Harbour cFunc:="_HB_FUN_"+cFunc

Obviously, in the libraries for Harbour the functions name for "native
Clipper" functions will have the form: "_HB_FUN_"+(function name limited to
10)
As example:  _HB_FUN_DBSELECTAR in place of  _HB_FUN_DBSELECTAREA

With this approach, we can manage legacy Clipper source code with 10 or
more chars in Clipper function name (like
DBSELECTAR(),DBSELECTARE(),DBSELECTAREA(), because is truncating to 10 as
Clipper do), and "new" Harbour code not belonging to Clipper with more than
10 char (if the programmer wish to use it), and in consecuence not limiting
the new posibilities opened by Harbour (function names longer than 10 chars).
In the last point, when an programmer compile in Clipper, an Harbour code
with functions names not belonging to "native Clipper", must consider that
those functions names with be truncated to 10 chars BY Clipper, as do with
all functions

Where should be applied this approach ? I do not know. Maybe in the same
place when the function name is converted to "_HB_FUN_"+function. I think
is an good place

I include an list of  ALL the functions listed in Clipper 5.3 Norton Guide
This list can be consider as the "native Clipper" functions, plus others
not included in NG, as example ISDISK()
Note that this is not valid for functions in Extend.lib and maybe others,
but cover allmost the functions that an "typical"  Clipper programmer use

Dave,

maybe I found out what to do :-)

But now I have a question: who is updating sourceforge's harbour page?

If you go here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/harbour-project/

it says that latest version is .35 !!

regards.

 No , Harbour should keep it functions as they are.
I´ll add  an module that will map all harbour functions to 10 chars

And as i know, i´ll think that will be dificult to some one build harbour
with HB_SYMBOL_NAME_LEN =10.

Luiz,

why not an #xcommand/xtranslate (maybe #define) inside common.ch?

I think that this issue should be solved without adding functions.

Then macros will not properly work.

XBase++ has the same problem, and we found 
that the Luiz proposal is the easiest and
simplest way to go.

Maybe we can review the present Harbour function list and make a complete
description of what is missing on every not finished function. For example
the Browse() function seems to be not finished (BTW there is a typo on the
Web pages, it says Stated instead of Started) but I really do not know if
someone knows what is missing:

First of all we need to know what is missing!!!!!

Then we should ask for volunteers to finish what is missing.

I found that Mlctopos() and Mpostolc() are not started at all, since I did
MlCount() and Memoline() I am the perfect candidate for those two functions,
and here is my commitment to finish those two functions ASAP. :-))

Clipper  maps function name to 10 chars while pre-processing

Hi Luiz,
the first file linked is the startup code c0w32, after there are the others
file.

I think initial procedure is the first procedure of the first obj linked.

But may I define it in other way ?

Ok, so if c0w32 is the first file, the first procedure in the second obj
linker is the initial procedure , right ?

But may I define manually the initial procedure, for example in the last
file ?

Message-ID: <3B8046A8.24446.DB9DD5@localhost>

Hi All,

I finally finished my modification about ::Super(::nX) as 
::Super:classname() wich was not returning the superclassname. (I 
will publish it in the next ours.

During my last test this WE, I discovered a GPF compiling certain 
test code wich where correctly compiled one or two weeks ago.

I finally reduced it to a very small prg of 3 lines.

/* This program will cause Harbour to GPF at compile time */
function main
Local a := Local a := { "&a", "Ch" }

return nil

/* But this one will compile correctly */
function main
Local a := Local a := { "a", "Ch" }
return nil

/* and now ... even more misterious ... this one appear also to 
compile */
function main
Local a := Local a := { "&a", "ab" }
return nil

In fact only the sequence where the first string contain at least two 
char wich the first equal to & and the second string _MUST_ begin 
wich Ch to cause the error.

This code was compiling I think two weeks ago.
The problem is the same either with Flex or Simplex version. I 
cleaned all my modifs and redo the test with the same result, (so 
it's not my code ;-)) )

Anyone any idea ?

Best regards,

Harbour process the symbols in the follow way.
First all init procedures and functions.
If your app has an Main() function then this is the follow function that is
processed (the main function can be defined on the first file linked , or
any other that is in the link script)
Otherwise. the initial procedure processed is the first procedure/function
of the first obj linked.

  In this case, I'd prefer a single todo.txt that has a clear divider
  between things that are accepted for beta 1 and those that are for
  later.
  But I can live with either.

Is there something wrong with it?

If the criteria that we drop a contribution is that the contributor 
leaves, then we have a whole lot more than Simplex to worry about.

You're right, it could do with cleaning up. If nobody else gets to it I'll
tidy it up this week.

What I'll probably do is simply remove the file releases from it as the
harbour downloads page is the best place to get harbour releases. Agreed?

Exactly, that's the reason I suggested it. The document would then list the
various things that need to be done to reach various states in harbour's
life to come, including what's needed to reach beta.

This is quite a common format for TODO documents.

I'd probably add to the licence details to point out that there's more

I think Antonio's concern here was onward development and upkeep. SimpLex is
in a pretty unique position of being a (and I don't mean this in a negative
way) redundant body of code within harbour. If the author of that code no
longer wishes to work on harbour and if nobody else is able or willing to
look after that body of code there's a danger that it'll fall behind the
Flex code. We'd then be in danger of having two internal versions of the
compiler that are very different.

Antonio's concern might be premature, but it seems well founded.

Does this mean that I should be able to uncomment the "Protected:" scope

  I believe Ron has every intention of supporting the public works he
  has created.  Until there's an unresolved problem with Simplex, I
  see no reason to remove it.  Many Harbour users have chosen to use
  it based on its merits.

Perhaps I'm missing something here but you seem to be asking how to have
class variables and class methods in harbour (see below) but the important
part of your example seems to revolve around the idea of friend classes. Is
the idea of friend class supposed to be important in the above?

> Also could someone give me a short example of a working code which uses

Here's a quick and dirty example that simply works with class variables:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "hbclass.ch"

Class NothingSpecial

   Exported:

      ClassVar nCount Init 0

      Method init

End Class

/////

Method init Class NothingSpecial

   ::nCount++

Return( self )

/////

Function Main()
Local n

   For n := 1 to 10

      // Create, and throw away, an instance of NothingSpecial.
      NothingSpecial():new()

      // Print the instance count class variable
      ? NothingSpecial():nCount

   Next

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

However, in playing with the above I can't get class methods to work how I'd
expect either. I suspect there might be a compiler bug lurking around here
some place.

I was expecting something like this:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "hbclass.ch"

Class NothingSpecial

   Exported:

      ClassVar nCount Init 0

      Method init

      Class Method sayInstanceCount

End Class

/////

Method init Class NothingSpecial

   ::nCount++

Return( self )

/////

Method sayInstanceCount Class NothingSpecial

   ? "We've had " + alltrim( str( ::nCount ) ) + " instances."

Return( self )

/////

Function Main()
Local n

   For n := 1 to 10

      // Create, and throw away, an instance of NothingSpecial.
      NothingSpecial():new()

      // Print the instance count class variable
      ? NothingSpecial():nCount

   Next

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

to work but that won't compile:

,----
| foo.prg(25) Error E0010 'Method "sayInstanceCount" not declared in class:
|                          NothingSpecial '
`----

Either I've got the above syntax wrong or the compiler has a problem with
class methods.

I'll CC this to the developer's list for their comments.

Done. If anyone does have any objections please note that all I've down is
remove old releases. Anyone wishing to maintain the file download section of
harbour's SourceForge page should step forward if they want to see it up to
date.

Annoyingly it would appear that it isn't possible to switch off the "Latest
File Releases" panel so it now reports:

,----
| This Project Has Not Released Any Files
`----

which is slightly misleading but I think we can live with it.

I've also turned off some of the other panels that we either don't use or no
longer make sense (for example, the news panel was way out of date and is
better served by the news on the front page of the harbour web site).

Shout if you've got any problems with the above.

Brian:

I read some times your message, but strictly speaking, I do not found the
reasons or the directions about what you try to say. Seem to be clear, but
inside, are just impressions

Really, does not have to much sense to answer this, but I did because maybe
is necesary some kind of communication and clarification

You seem to stay in some kind of "shock" or confution, like when you see
how an friend is "offended" and you "feel" the responsability to react and
defend him, even if that is not true, or if he is guilty or cause those
reactions. By my side, I see different what is happening

Yes, I "grossly  oversimplified things" because I only remarked what was
happening, in others words, only expose the "hurt not closed", but I never
"imply it was all Ron's fault", I only say that the group were in other
"Ron's endless discussion"
About "as if he created all  the tense energy alone", you, I and many know
that in an group exist this kind of discussions, many are healthy, but many
others just spoil to all and should be limited, not caring who or the
quality of the guilty. The common benefit is the best in the groups

>  Do you have ANY idea how many
>  times someone reported a problem--anywhere from a superficial bug to
>  a major hole in processing--and NO ONE else responded?
Yes, I have seen that many times: Do not exist an effective scheme to
attend and redirect this reports

>  So perhaps it is best he work independently now.  But if you are
>  going to step in and write an epitaph for a man's work, you can't
>  just write about the dirty laundry. =20
Remember, no one crucified Ron, and your message seem to try to state like
if this happened

>  Ron fixed HUNDREDS of things for people like yourself when no one
>  else would take the time to help.
>Every time you deliver an app
>  using Harbour, it will be using more of his code than you know.
>  Until you check those ChangeLogs.
You seem to stay offended when you said this, thinking that the other side
does not have knowledge of what was happening
Many of us know, because you and I and others are not fool, that Ron have
one of the highest rating of contributions to Harbour, from short fixing to
big models, and simulate to ignore that is "hipocresia". But remember, even
if that people is the best but some aspects affect the group, it should be
remarked and tried to correct. The succesful in some models does not imply
liberty to impose all the models
The final decision of "how" each one can contribute, is personal. This is
the right of everyone, but must see how their right affect the rights of an
group. Harbour Is not an personal project of an single dancer, is an
"Tango' dancer group"

If you review this "daily digest", you can see an big change on it. Many of
the messages refer to an "todo list" to an specific goal. The last time
that I see that intention and that degree of enthusiasm(?) was more than
one year ago. Every one want to participate

Maybe now Harbour can join again people like Matt Hamilton,  Peter
Townsend,  Patrick Mast ,  Jean-Francois Lefebvre,   Richard-Alexandre
Cuylen,  Felipe Coury,  Luiz Rafael Culik ,  Paul Tucker,  Bil Simser,
April White,  Leslee Griffith,  Gonzalo Diethelm,  Dave Pearson,  Victor
Szak=E1ts,  Andi Jahja, Chen Kedem,  Matteo Baccan ,  Maurilio Longo ,  Kwon=
,
Oh-Chul ,  Eddie Runia, Robert Arseniuk, Ryszard Glab,  Alexander S.
Kresin, Vladimir Kazimirchik , Rab Thomson,  Antonio Linares ,  Ignacio
Ortiz de Zuniga , Bruno Cantero , Jose Lalin, Manuel Ruiz, David G. Holm ,
Mark W. Schumann, Phil Barnett , Tim Stone ,  Jon Berg Stoker,  Ross
Presser, Janica Lubos, Nicolas del Pozo,  and Brian Hays,  Ron Pinkas=20

(No, I am not an genius. I only took the Crew list )
Many of them are active, other long time ago leave the group (tired, I do
not know), and others are not mentionated, as example some which sign as
Mabster, Wosniak, ...., and some with references to third party RDD,
magazine reviews, and so on ...
Of course, must be included too the invaluable "anonymous user" and "heroic
tester", who sometimes remember us the goals and "back to earth" with an
simple "talk" about "Harbour is not working ! "

Forget to see this like "against Ron", that is not happening, and you must
be sure about what I am saying

If you still have some kind of doubts about the needs of Harbour movement
and specifics goals to the group, review the included messages of more than
one year old

I suggest in addition that *all* the developers, in an *personal* homework,
do an overall review to Harbour comparing with Clipper and listing what
he/she see as missing and/or different, and then compare the list and
reduce to an single "to do" (Varias cabezas piensan mejor que una, y con
muchos ojos aun mejor )
Wait, wait, wat, do not use that ugly Babel translator
(Many heads think better than one, and with many eyes even better)

Could be neccesay an "Captain" to manage and remark actions based in this
kind of list. Think on it, is necesary some reminder
(Do not think on me,  I exclude myself of this kind of work. I prefer to
help Harbour from outside)

Subject: [Harbour] dispbox() error
Message-ID: <3B80D495.5C8EAB89@libero.it>

Hi, this little program draws a line on screen if compiled with clipper,
but nothing if compiled
with harbour on OS/2 GCC emx or Win32 BCC

function Main()

   DispBox(1, 1, 1, 80, Space(9), "W+/B, N/BG")

return nil

And, looking at this problem, I've found out that someone wrote pieces
of gtos2.c which are wrong.

For example hb_gt_Replicate() is made on the assumption that if you
write inside screen memory you will see what you write on screen. But
this not true on OS/2 :-)

Not only that, there are FAR qualifiers which do nothing on OS/2.

regards.

We don't appear to have that degree of control over the content of the files
panel.

I think I might have found the reason why the profiler TBrowse reporter
example is now falling over with a RTE. Consider this code:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "hbclass.ch"

Create Class Parent

   Exported:

      Method init

End Class

Method init Class Parent

   ? "Parent::init()"

Return( self )

Create Class Child

   Exported:

      Method init

End Class

Method init Class Child

   ::super:init()
   ? "Child::init()"

Return( self )

Function Main()

   Child():new()

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

The output I'd expect from that code is:

,----
| Parent::init()
| Child::init()
`----

but all I get is:

,----
| Child::init()
`----

It would appear that the super call simply isn't happening.

Yes. I've also done some digging into the "memoedit" problem I mentioned in
my other email and have realised that it's nothing to do with memoedit()
failing to display anything, the problem is that my classes now no longer
work because ::super: calls are, from what I can tell, no longer doing the
right thing.

I was intending to, but I wanted to know if the changes you'd made should
have fixed this problem. There' little point in reporting known bugs that
you hadn't intended to fix with the changes you made.

> Let me know the result,

As you can see from my other emails I didn't get the chance to conduct the
test as other significant problems have appeared.

Some todo items:

- Optimizing out the need for the PUSHNIL opcode before 
each function call.

- Eliminating the "#pragma pack" type of hacks from the 
code (especially RDD), to make it more multiplatform, this 
mostly involves changing the direct writing of structures to the

Having just refreshed harbour here and rebuilt everything I did a quick test
with the profiler.prg test code and suffered this runtime error:

,----
| Error BASE/1068  Argument error: array access
| Called from HB_PROFILEREPORTTOTBROWSE:CURRENTENTITY(773)

`----

This is when the final array browsing test takes place. This wasn't
previously a problem. I'll do some more debugging to get to the bottom of
the problem but I thought it worth mentioning in the mean time as it appears
to be a change in behaviour of some valid test code due do to the above CVS
commit.

I also notice that the memoedit()'s used to view the text output in the
profiler.prg tests are now misbehaving too but I think that's unrelated. Can
anyone on platforms other than GNU/Linux have a play with that and see what
you get?

Hmm, I've just noticed that the above might not make sense in that the email
I'm referring to doesn't appear to have made it to the harbour mailing list
for some reason (unless it's delayed somewhere).

Anyway, since you committed the class system changes all sorts of odd things
have started to happen with the test code in profiler.prg. If you want to
test this out for yourself simply compile profiler.prg as:

,----
| harbour profiler -n -m -w -p -d__TEST__
`----

link it up and have a play. You'll notice that the string reporter no longer
returns the report as a string, instead the report gets written to screen.
This appears to be because the wrong ::writeLines() is being called (the one
from HB_ProfileReport instead of HB_ProfileReportToArray::writeLines(),
HB_ProfileReportToString inherits from HB_ProfileReportToArray which in turn
inherits from HB_ProfileReport).

Just to confirm that the above isn't something odd with memoedit() but,
instead, it's down the ::super: call problem that I've since documented.

You have:

So there's no super class!  Looks like you wanted Child to inherit
Parent. :-)

I think I've seen my error, I can test it here, but will do it as soon as 
I'm back at home.

Sorry for the delay.

JF,

I have this error after your latest changes:

Error BASE/1081  Argument error: +
Called from TEDITOR:REFRESHWINDOW(590)
Called from TSQLEDITOR:NEW(134)
Called from MAIN(62)

In TEditor:RefreshWindow(590) there is a call to Scroll(::x, ::y...) and
TSQLEditor is derived from TEditor.

It was working ok yesterday.

regards.

Yes, I know, I will correct, it ASAP (today). But I can't compile

This will be fixed with ChangeLog 2001-08-20 17:45 UTC+0100 (after it

More tests show that:

1) This sample does not work either on OS/2 or on Win32 because nRight is >
than MaxCol()
2) Even if I set nRight < than MaxCol() this does not work on OS/2 because
of wrong functions
    inside gtos2.c
3) It always works on CLIPPER.

Ryszard:

  In a Windows app, we've been trying to call hb_gcAll() whenever a
  dialog closes as an attempt to get it called regularly.
  Though this helps, we've found in automated tests that the app
  eventually crashes from memory problems.
  If we assign hb_gcAll() to a menu option and call it directly in the
  test script, the app runs almost forever.

  It's my educated guess that having the garbage collector doing its
  thing while Windows is in the middle of doing lots of activity is
  not the way to go.  GC really should happen at an idle state.
  But we don't know a good way to do that....

Blast! Apologies to J. for the misleading bug report. I've been trying to
come up with a condensed version of the problem today and I thought I'd hit
on something close there <sigh>.

Needless to say, there is a problem. Try running up the debugger or playing
with the profiler.prg example code for example.

It truncates all symbols after 10 digits, which is what you get if you
build Harbour with strict Clipper 5.2 compatibility mode enabled.

Message-ID: <20010820175841.T1437@hagbard.davep.org>

An alternative to using a file in the doc directory for tracking TODO items
might be to use SourceForge's tracker system. It's possible for an admin to
create any type of tracker so creating a tracker for TODO items would be
easy enough.

So, if there's a strong preference for managing this on-line we can use that
facility rather than doing it via a in-CVS file.

See <URL:http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=681> to see harbour's
current tracker items.

 I'm sure that in to-do list for beta should present only those tasks,
 which are really missing for basic Clipper functionality. This
 doesn't mean, of course, that everybody should stop their work on
 other tasks, or that these other tasks aren't important, but to-do
 for beta is to-do for beta, and from this point of view only few
 positions, posted in this thread, really should be included there.

Why do we need to add those functions with short name when we can simply

Store a text file in a similar manner as the now obsolete Harbour image
files were stored, then specify that file as a download image in the
reference page.

I am sure there are more sophisticated methods also, but they seem
complicated to me.

(But consider the source)..

I'm in the process of rewriting the box and line drawing functions to
do proper screen boundary clipping, like Clipper does. I only have gtwin
converted so far and I can't commit anything until I have all GT
libraries converted, because part of the change involves changing the
USHORT row and column variables to SHORT (which I'm only doing for the
box and line display functions).

This change also points out the idiocy of using type prefixes on
descriptive variable names, because now the functions have variables
named 'uiLeft', etc. that are no longer of type 'ui'. Had the variables
simply been named 'left', etc., I wouldn't be faced with the dilemma of
either wasting my time renaming the variables or leaving a future
maintenance problem...

Seeing as I did up some of this (carrying forward what was already
created...) I will do this if you like.

I don't recall right now where the clipping took place in Clipper but if it
were at the higher level, then the current declaration would be correct.  (I
do plan to go over this one day, believe it or not :-)

Message-ID: <12524940352.20010820173512@abacuslaw.com>


  DTOC does not obey __SetCentury status.  I works purely off of the
  DateFormat string Set(4).  Even if dateformat is "mm/dd/yyyy", if
  SET CENTURY  is OFF it must return a 2-digit year.

  Is anyone familiar  with the code in dateshb.c?  I'm not sure if the
  fix should be in dtoc itself or in the hb_dateFormat() that it calls.

I already have it mostly done.

It could be, but the Harbour GT implementation leaves the details of
box and line drawing up to the individual GT library. Fortunately, most
of them use the exact same code and only a few have minor changes to the
code, so once I had the GTWIN code changed and tested, it was only a
matter of cut and paste for all but two of the libraries, GTCRS and
GTSLN, which only required doing a manual diff and porting back in the
minor code differences.

I am intimately familiar with that code. There is nothing in

David,

PMFJI, but your code is not asking the right question!

Try this:

set date format to 'yyyy-mm-dd'
? set(_SET_DATEFORMAT)
? __setcentury()
? date()
? dtoc(date())

set century off
? set(_SET_DATEFORMAT)

        SET CENTURY ON/OFF actually goes to the DateFormat and

  Well, what I really have to explain is why __setCentury works
  correctly in my small test too, but fails in the large app that has
  identical code.

  I may have just found it: My app has a saved setting for date
  format. There's nothing in Harbour that keeps us from setting the
  date format to yyyy when SetCentury is currently ON, putting things
  out of sync in the way it looks for a changed setting.

  Will confirm shortly...

Paul:

Thanks.  It seems that Clipper will change the SetCentury setting to
.T. if the dateformat string has 4 y's.

The ultimate test is this simple:
? __setcentury()
set date format to 'mm/dd/yyyy'
? __setcentury() // changes to .t. in clipper
? dtoc(date())

David: Sorry I didn't isolate it better first; in the main app the
misbehavior was so blatant I put up the msg before reducing it.

Can you change this for me?

This almost reveals the real problem. I added a ? __setcentury() ahead
of the set date format and discovered that the problem is that Clipper
sets century to true when a 4 digit date format is set, but Harbour does
not. Fortunately, this will be easy to fix.

Clipper *also* does this, but only if the set century value changes.
The *actual* bug is that Harbour doesn't set the century value to .T.
when setting a date format with a four digit year, so that when the SET
CENTURY OFF code executes, Harbour doesn't do anything, because it
thinks that century is already off. I'll fix the actual bug...

The GTCGI, GTOS2, GTSTD, and GTWIN libraries are tested (both

I ran your suggested program in Clipper v5.1 and latest Harbour.
Environment:  DOS (Windows 98) and cygwin.

Both (Harbour and Clipper) line draw functions generate b/w lines across the
screen, including column 80.

However, using the (same?) functions to draw a box, it looks like column 80
does not display under Harbour, while it does under Clipper.   Deleting the
color options did not make a difference.

In other words, both screens look identical, except:

Clipper = 10 horizontal "x" characters in the filled boxes at the right side
of the screen.
Harbour = 9 horizontal "x" characters in the filled boxes at the right side
of the screen.

Both programs filled boxes with 10 "x" characters at the left side of the
screen.

Also, the system screen default is restored to 80x24 under Harbor, but is
left at 80x50 under Clipper 5.1 when the program exits.

The DOS system prompt appears on line 5 when the Clipper executable exits,
but appears on line 3 after the Harbour executable exits.

Ahh, right, I'm with you. Sort of have a "down-from-harbour-web-site.txt"
file for download that tells them where to download from? Yeah, I guess I
could do that. Although I suspect that the sort of person who has gone
looking for downloads on our SourceForge page will figure out that there's a
harbour web site proper.

Just a note to conform that this reversal has removed the problems I was
getting.

Two issues from my recent changes need extra attention since they may
seem buried in the list, and one change may BREAK CURRENT CODE.

First, notice the bitflags.c in libgt. These are very handy routines
written by Dave Pearson for managing a bit-map of flags, stored in a
string variable or field. (Thanks, Dave!)
I made a few modifications to port to Harbour.

Now for the WARNING part:
OrdCondSet had an incorrect parameter list after the 11th parameter.
(The Clipper docs were wrong).
If you were using any of the fancy Clipper 5.3/COMIX clauses
for ADDITIVE, USECURRENT, CUSTOM or NOOPTIMIZE,
these parameters are shifted back now.

The current code and preprocessor are coordinated now, so if you
simply use the straight INDEX ON command, you probably don't need to
change your code.  But if you had altered any of your own headers to
work with the prior Harbour, or had hard-coded calls to OrdCondSet(),
you may need to change things to accommodate the NIL 12th parameter.

For more details, see the Harbour Archives, subject "XINDEX warning"

Luiz:

Thanks for your attention and work
This will work with functions inside macros or codeblocks too ?
 As example  { |n| dbselectarea(n) }

I supposed that, because you look so healthy
You were heared, this has been done and your words are now in the Universal
History

Can be included "Memory not released"in "todo list" for beta 1 ? This error
happen often

DAMC> happen often

  It doesn't really help to list it as a topic by itself, since
  any piece of code could result in unreleased blocks.
  
  What we *really* need from you and other Harbour users are specific
  examples of what produces the error.  It takes time to reduce the
  problem to a 10-line example, but if no one takes that time it won't
  get fixed. Often 95% of the effort in debugging is in clearly
  identifying it. The people doing the low-level coding usually won't
  spend hours chasing a vague bug if that first level of debugging
  hasn't been done to narrow down the possibilities.
  When an issue IS clearly defined, someone will usually fix it right
  away.

  Thanks again for your input--especially on the ordCondSet topic.
  Keep it coming.

   * contrib/libgt/bitflags.c
      added the cvs header
   + todo.txt
      first stab at a todo list

Since several people responded in the format I offered for a todo
list, I gathered the items and got it started.

I am not married to this format by any means, I'm just trying to keep
the ball rolling.  The SourceForge tools seem like a great idea, but
web interfaces are sometimes too time consuming and people just don't
take the time to update them.  If we decide to switch, I'll be happy
to make the initial conversion.

v1.28 of the harbour FAQ is now online. It's a small change to question 3.7
<URL:http://www.davep.org/harbour/FAQ/harbour-3.html#ss3.7>. Before it said
that a TODO list needed doing. We've now got a TODO list so it points at
that.

My copy of the FAQ is already updated, the version on the harbour web site
will be updated when Phil's auto-update job kicks in.

Short (10 chars) version of function doesn't resolve a problem eg.

dbselectarea_of_my_customer( "customer" ) works fine in clipper
but there is no way to map this function and similar without
cutting all symbols to 10 chars.

My suggestion is crummy, I agree.  I don't know if the Sourceforge entry
must be an ftp instruction, but apparently it can't be a simple URL to the
Harbour download page.

There appear to be a number of inactive projects listed in Sourceforge, or
that was my impression when I browsed through their catalog.  My concern was
that Harbour might also be mistaken as inactive.  I wonder if this is an
issue to be taken up with Sourceforge?

My assessment of whether a group (or individual) had progressed beyond the
project announcement stage was (1) project status and (2) whether any code
was released.  If the statement was made "This project has not released any
code", I took it to mean what it said.  Could be a small group was
developing a project in a closed environment, and would release code only
after reaching beta status, or perhaps code had been withdrawn or?

The line drawing differences are due to the CRS line drawing functions
being used for line drawing. Apparently they won't draw if the start
area is off screen to the left.

For the box drawing, the same code is used in all libraries, aside from
minor differences in the character set hacks for GTCRS and GTSLN, so I'm
at a loss as to why GTCRS looks so different from everything else.

BUG?  I thought those were nasty critters that buzzed around 3:00am or so
before diving in for a spot of blood.  Only way to swat them is to use one
of the large glossy mags that come in the mail (which no one reads) and
flatten the beasts against the wall.

Naw, can't call it a bug if it is work in progress.

Looks good now, too.  Thank you!

This case seem different and do not belong to an "specific" error that the
user can re-produce

In the cases I have seen, nothing indicate some kind of problem. The
program run well, but at exit, show *sometimes* the message of "memory not
released". What cause the error ? None apparent process

For that I think that the review belong to the programmer. Seeing the
posible modules of Harbour code maybe he will find some "piece not set in
his place"

The "10 lines" that I included show one specific piece of code (fm.c)
Other start point could be what was refered a long time ago. Down I attach
the message
Remember, in many cases does not exist an "Runtime error" to have "memory
not released"

Remembering some of the previous message:

>fm.c:442: HB_TR_ERROR Block 10 (size 40) SGBLOCK(2966)

>In others runs, show different number of lines (blocks)

>Line SGBLOCK( 2966 ) is an code block creation:

>where bBloque is an valid character expresion to create an code block,
including their | | characters

>This error has been happening along differents versions of Harbour
(0.33,0.34,0.35, ...0.37) in Windows 98, OS/2, WIndows 2000 ...

>Maurilio Longo reviewed something like this in OS/2 weeks ago. Ocurrs
mainly with creation and maybe evaluation of code blocks

I said too that the function SGBLOCK() refered in the "10 lines" make an
code block from an character expresion, using macros
One posibility could be the "management of memory" in the "macro process",
which maybe sometimes complete the process but not release some blocks of
memory used in that

Maybe others developers have seen others cases differents to "macro", where
"memory not released" happen. If only happen in macros, is an good point to
start the review

David:

  All I can offer at the moment is that I have a large FW app that is
  based on runtime compilation of codeblocks. If I turn tracing on, I
  no longer get any unreleased blocks reported (I did at one time).
  Does it only happen when using DBFNTX? Last I heard, there was still
  a lot to be finished in that rdd, which could be the source of leaks.

  Can you produce any reported leaks using only RDDADS?

In-Reply-To: <200108211600.f7LG0sn17419@mail.udg.mx>
Message-ID: <3.0.6.16.20010822042341.1d4fde2a@mail.udg.mx>

I delayed this message for many months, but now is here at last

Maybe the Harbour developers are aware of the contents of this message, o
maybe not, as happened with OrdCondSet(); in such case, this information
can serve as reference

The content is focused to:
1.- Developers of RDD DBFCDX
2.- ADS support in Harbour

Time ago, when I made changes to an Clipper 5.3 program in order to manage:
- Clipper DBFNTX, Clipper DBFCDX
- Advantage DBFNTXAX, Advantage DBFCDXAX

I found that there are many differences between RDD's, specially between
Clipper DBFCDX - Advantage DBFCDXAX, mainly because Advantage DBFCDXAX is
"oriented" to FoxPro implementation, and NOT Clipper implementation

Because this can affect Clipper DBFCDX - Harbour DBFCDX compatibility, is
convenient to take it in care

Next are a brief discussion of differences
a.- OrdCondSet(): There are differents arguments and default values for
RDD. This was reviewed before and done in Harbour (I hope)

b.- CDXLOCK.obj: Advantage use the locking scheme of FoxPro. CDXLOCK.obj
must be linked with Clipper to acquire this scheme

c.- SET( _SET_MBLOCKSIZE, 64 )      //Igualar a DBFCDXAX y FoxPro
  FoxPro use 64 as default, 
  Advantage use 64 as default, 
  Clipper 5.3a use ** 32 ** as default, 
  Clipper 5.3b use ** 64 ** as default
  Below 32, there different behaviour between FoxPro, Advantage, Clipper

d.- AX_SetMemoBlock( 64 )           //Advantage RDD
  I am not sure why must be used in Advantage, but this is in AXNTXCDX.ch
#command SET MEMOBLOCK TO <value>                                          ;
      => AX_SetMemoBlock( <value> )                                        ;
       ; dbInfo( 39, <value> )                                      <-----
DAVID note: must be an DBF opened

  I apply:      SET( _SET_MBLOCKSIZE, 64 ) 
                     AX_SetMemoBlock( 64 )

e.-  AX_ChooseOrdBagExt( ".CDX" )    //de .IDX a .CDX, para igualar a DBFCDX
   Advantage use ".IDX" as index extension default
   Clipper       use ".CDX" as index extension default (or fixed?)

f.-   AX_MemoArrayStyle( "FlexFile" )  //Igualar a DBFCDX
  Advantage manage formats "FlexFile" and "Six", and use "Six" as default
  Clipper only manage "FlexFile"

Below the message are the code that I use to manage the differences between
RDD
Note that all RDD must be set before to the default RDD, in order to set
the proper values for each one and can be used later, in the form:
SGRDD("DBFCDX")
SGRDD("DBFCDXAX")
SGRDD("DBFNTX")   (really this is unnecesary)
SGRDD( cRDDomision )  //Establecer RDD por omision   (default RDD)

Observations:
1.- This is an question
  Are the functions mentionated in Advantage RDD for Clipper, included in
ADS support in Harbour ?
  By example:  AX_SetMemoBlock( 64 ),  AX_ChooseOrdBagExt( ".CDX" ),
AX_MemoArrayStyle( "FlexFile" )

2.- In Harbour DBFCDX, do not forget to review the Clipper compatibility in
the proper commands:
SET AUTOPEN 	Sets/Gets automatic open mode.  When a production index is
                attached to a data file, when that data file is USEd, the
                index is open automatically.  Setting AUTOPEN off will not
                open the production index file.

SET AUTORDER  	Allows control of the master index which is in effect when a
                production index is used.  Setting the order to 0, orders the
                database in natural order while setting the order to 1, sets
                the first index to the active index.

SET AUTOSHARE   Autoshare allows the CDX driver to automatically open the
                index in exclusive mode if not running on the network and in
                SHARED mode if running on a network.

SET MBLOCKSIZE 	Change the block size for memo files of newly created memo
SET MEMOBLOCK   files.  You cannot change the block size of existing files.

SET MFILEEXT	Change the extension used for memo fields.

SET OPTIMIZE    Query optimization can be turned off by using the SET OPTIMIZE
                OFF command.  By default, query optimization is on.

SET STRICTREAD  When creating an index with the CDX driver, _DBFCDX bypasses
                the standard RDD hierarchy calls which force "read one record
                at time".  Instead, by default, _DBFCDX reads several records
                at once (into a big buffer);  this makes index creation up to
                two times faster.  However, this technique defeats some
                libraries (such as encryption RDDs) which depend on the
                strict RDD hierarchy calls being made.  Thus, "strict reads"
                can be turned on via SET STRICTREAD ON.

David Arturo,

Since we have an OS/2 version of harbour (on which I've spent a _lot_ of
hours :-)) I would not use Odin (which is a Win32 emulator like Wine) to run
them and, to answer your second question, a program compiled on linux cannot
run under XFree86/2 since executable file formats are quite different and
OS/2 cannot load a linux exutable (not to mention that this linux executable
could request linux dynamic libraries).

Sadly enough I don't have time to look at FiveWin sources which could be
ported to OS/2 (OS/2 PM and Win32 are very similar in a lot of aspects like
WM_ messages, resouce files, event handling etc) with, in my opinion, a
modest effort.

regards.

To Alexander S.Kresin:

I tested DBC3_0.zip and I get:
Unrecoverable error 415: Cannot open overlay file 'DBC.EXE'

This happened in Windows 2000; under OS/2 DOS session it run fine

DBCAX3_0.zip
It run under with Win2000 and OS/2 DOS session. Not tested with ADS

DBCHX3_1.zip     Compiled with Harbour / ADS
Can not run under OS/2 DOS session. (Obviously, is an Win32 program)
Under ODIN cannot show the texts and can  not manage keyboard inputs

Run under Windows 2000, using Local ADS
But when I modify structure adding an field, I get:

Error BASE/1003   Variable does not exist: PASNET

and left: dbcstru.dbf, a0_new.FPT, a0_new-dbf

This change work fine in DBC3_0.zip under OS/2 DOS session

Maybe there are some problem in Harbour code and/or ADS for Harbour code,
or at last in DBCHX3_1.zip

 I never tried it under Win2000.
 But I read somewhere, that for Win2000 Blinker 6 is needed, maybe,
 that's the reason.

 That was Harbour's problem with expressions like

 Now it fixed, but I didn't upload new dbchx version yet. Will do it

David,

I don't know, this is an issue which arises from the way VIO windows work.

If you write onto the Logical Video Buffer whatever you write won't be shown on screen until
after you call VioShowBuf().

hb_gt_DispEnd() inside gtos2.c resyncs all of the LVB even if you changed a single character
(maybe via hb_gt_xPutch()) so calling hb_gt_DispBegin()/hb_gt_DispEnd() from, say,
hb_gt_xPutch() is a big waste of time, and if, for any reason you want every write to happen
on screen imediatly those calls will not respect the harbour level code logic.

regards.

How about alternating the return value from ReadKey in gtcgi between 0 and
13 on successive calls.. so that a prog expecting redirected input and
looping till inkey() == 0 doesn't get stuck in a loop, but neither does a
prog looping till inkey() != 0

Just a thought. Sorry I can't contribute much at present.. lot on plate..

Dear Friends

    Harbour binaries build with Borland C++ 5.5.1 by default can only open
48 files at an time, the attached file, increase this ability to 255 files
open under Borland C++ 5.5.1, Just link the files to your application or add
them to your rtl.lib(both files was compiled with bcc32 5.5.1)

I still think that this does not have nothing with RDD. Remember and think
it account:
>>This error has been happening along differents versions of Harbour
>(0.33,0.34,0.35, ...0.37) in Windows 98, OS/2, WIndows 2000 ...

Older releases do not use DBFNTX, DBFCDX
and, until 0.37, I begun to use databases, and not before. I still do not
use RDDADS in Harbour, just an single DBFNTX or DBFCDX file without index

What means: " If I turn tracing on, I no longer get any unreleased blocks
reported (I did at one time)." ?

I think the error is around "macros" and their memory management

Yes, I use the Harbour OS/2 version and is stable, fast and work fine
I tested Harbour Win32 under ODIN-OS/2 just by curiosity,  and it work.
ODIN is advancing with good results

But definitively, under OS/2, is better Harbour for OS/2. Your work give
fruits

OK
as another question: can Harbour for Linux compile Harbour programs under
XFree86/2 ? or I am confused ?

That will be great, if could be done. But maybe we wiill not see that

You are worked with OS/2 - Harbour - MySQL. I am correct ? If is true, what
you say about performance ?

Is compiled with Clipper / Blinker 4 or 5 ? It should work without troubles
The only problem that I have with Clipper programs under Win2000, is when
are linked with LLibG libraries, in either text or graphic mode. Show
"Divide overflow" at startup and fail to run, but only if I have Full
Screen. Starting in Window Screen work fine, and if I change to Full
Screen, continue working fine
All other Clipper programas run fine under Win2000

OK, not all. With Clipper/Advantage RDD I have the well known problem
..CMD(1015) DBUSEAREA(). Simply can not connect to ADS

If someone has resolved this, let know us

We do have a working FiveOS2, though we droped its development
cause such a little market response. I always enjoyed OS2 very
much.

We could consider to provide its source code to Harbour, if
there is some interest for it.

David Arturo,

A linux program (a linux executable) cannot be run by OS/2, they have a
completely different format and request different services to the operating
system.

XFree86/2 is an OS/2 executable recompiled from XFree86 sources.

The same holds true for the linux version of harbour which is a linux executable.
Win32 harbour can be run by OS/2 using Odin because Odin reads the Win32
executable (which OS/2 doesn't know how to handle) and converts it (on the fly)
into an OS/2 one.

About OS/2 - harbour - MySQL/2 I can say that speed is good and stability is also
very good. I have only little utilities which use my /contrib/mysql class but
some of them require a couple of days of continous work to convert flat files
into MySQL tables and they work nicely.

regards.

Maurilio,

Our code was designed to work with Clipper
on OS2, so it may needs some adaptations 
and changes to be sure it properly works
under 32 bits.

If you want, I may send you portions of it,
and you may try them under OS2 32 bits, just
to be sure everything works ok, until we get
the whole thing running fine :-)

What C compiler do you use ? 
We used Borland C 16 bits for OS2 :-)
(that later on, Borland also droped...)

I know that there have been talking about
using GTK or similars to not reinvent the wheel...

But we (FiveTech) are so used to GUIs, that I believe
that we could build some basic GUIs elements
without too much work, that could run on all
operating systems quite easily, without having to
use GTK or so...

Any comments ?

Just try the code below on harbour win32 console mode with and with out the
patch. I suggest you to use the harbour/tests directory for the test

func main
Local aDir:={}
local aHand:={}
Local iHand
Local nPos
adir:=directory('*.*')

   for nPos:=1 to len(adir)
      ? 'Cur Position',nPos
      iHand:=fopen(adir[npos,1])
      aadd(ahand,ihand)
      ?'curhandle',iHand
   next
for nPos:=1 to len(aHand)
   fclose(ahand[nPos])
next

return nil

To work in X at the GUI level you're probably used to working at you'd want
to be looking at something like GTK (note I'm only thinking about X oriented
platforms here). AIUI, without it or something similar, you'll be having to
personally implement all the controls you're used to using under many GUIs.

X is more of a networking protocol than it is a GUI, hence the reason that
"widget sets" such as QT and GTK exist.

Antonio,

I use GCC, but if your code uses native OS/2 calls it makes not such a
difference, look at gtos2.c which compiles either with GCC or with IBM
VisualAge C++.

PS. If you want I can sign a NDA with you.

Antonio,

I think it is better to use native widgets or else your application will
look poor.

Maurilio,

It is not needed by now. Anyhow, as I have explained 
you our code was designed for CA-Clipper.

So my idea, is that I may send you little 
portions that you may test with Harbour, until
we reach a point where the whole thing may
entirely run. Is that ok ?

I'm not sure whether these merit inclusion in the To Do, but I got the
warnings below building the current CVS using MS VC++.

Mostly they look like missing casts, but casting away "const" looks
worrying.

Maurilio,

On a very first stage, we may build a mainos2.c
(same as there are a mainstd.c and mainwin.c) module 
that lets Harbour use the presentation manager GUI.

Seems that ok for you ?

Antonio,

mainwin.c does not create any window.

An OS/2 PM program is the very same VIO program which issues a
WinInitialize() and a WinCreateMsgQueue() call.

At this point PM changes screen context from VIO to PM; I think I should
not call WinCreateStdWin() but simply enter vm_Do().

I mean, are FiveWin windows created by .PRG code (which, calls some C
helper function) or are they created by main() function before calling
vm_Do()?

As soon as I have your answer I'll write mainpm.c (since PM is the
difference and not OS/2).

regards.

This is basically the code we used (adapted to Harbour):

#define INCL_BASE
#define INCL_WIN
#define INCL_GPI

#include <os2.h>
#include "hbapi.h"

HAB  hab;         /* Anchor Table handle */
HMQ  hmq;         /* Message Queue handle */

int main( int argc, char * argv[] )
{
   hab = WinInitialize( 0 );
   hmq = WinCreateMsgQueue( hab, 0 );

   hb_cmdargInit( argc, argv );
   hb_vmInit( TRUE );

   WinDestroyMsgQueue( hmq );
   WinTerminate( hab );

   hb_vmQuit();

   return 0;
}

HAB GetHab( void ) { return hab; }

HB_FUNC( GETHAB ) 
{ 
   hb_retnl( ( LONG ) GetHab() ); 
}

If it is ok, then we may already show a simple PM wellcome

The TODO list sort of has an implied "fix all known bugs" and I'd suggest
that such compiler warnings are bugs(ish). If it isn't something that's
going to be cleaned up RSN it's worth creating an entry in the bug tracker.

So, have you been able to get the MsgInfo() test running ?

Maurilio,

I am not 100% sure if hb_vmQuit() call
should be after WinTerminate() or after
hb_vmInit( TRUE ).

You may test both possibilities.

Thanks,

Antonio

Maurilio,

Also, we may rename GetHab() to
hb_GetHab() or hb_pmGetHab().

Antonio,

WinTerminate returns so hb_vmQuit() should be called after it but, at
this point there, is no way to display anything on screen and we cannot
call any WinXXX() function from inside hb_vmQuit().

Look at the attachement :-)))))))))

regards.

Antonio,

no, I did not try to call hb_vmQuit() before since hb_vmQuit() does not
return.

Let's go with next step :-)

regards.

It would be great if someone could follow
the same steps on Linux, that we are doing 
with OS2 GUI.

Any Linux master there ? :-)

We should change hb_vmQuit() to make it return...

(it is also needed for Harbour mainwin.c)

Up to now we already have a multiplatform code,
(very basic, I agree) but it completely hides the
own complexity of each operating system.

When we do:

function Main()

   MsgInfo( "Welcome to Harbour GUI" )

return nil

we don't need to worry about the underlaying
operating system specific requirements. That
is great! :-) We don't force the
programmer to learn each operating system
own API functions. That is the key! :-)

On a next step, we may focus on developing
a very basic Class TForm, that again may run
on any operating system, without requiring
source code changes.

David:

I can respond regarding rddads. Remember, it is using the ACE32.DLL
which lacks some capabilities they were able to code into the clipper
rdd (ace32 can be used by any Windows app and is not
clipper-specific).

DAMC> Next are a brief discussion of differences
DAMC> a.- OrdCondSet(): There are differents arguments and default values for
DAMC> RDD. This was reviewed before and done in Harbour (I hope)
OrdCondSet() has a single implementation with Clipper 5.3b's parameter
list.  Only rddads uses parameters after #11 now.

DAMC> b.- CDXLOCK.obj: Advantage use the locking scheme of FoxPro. CDXLOCK.obj
DAMC> must be linked with Clipper to acquire this scheme
I don't think this is an option in rddads (32-bit Advantage clients
are limited to ACE32.DLL capabilities).
I'll double-check.

DAMC> c.- SET( _SET_MBLOCKSIZE, 64 )      //Igualar a DBFCDXAX y FoxPro
DAMC>   FoxPro use 64 as default, 
DAMC>   Advantage use 64 as default, 
DAMC>   Clipper 5.3a use ** 32 ** as default, 
DAMC>   Clipper 5.3b use ** 64 ** as default
DAMC>   Below 32, there different behaviour between FoxPro, Advantage, Clipper
See Advantage docs for their specifications.
All the SET commands can be better integrated when we have the SET
LISTENER stuff available. For now, you need to use ads.ch to try to
integrated these, but there's no way to enforce consistency until the
Listener stuff works.
Some of the SETs you mention are in ads.ch. Rather than add the
others, I'll wait to see how the Listener works.

DAMC> e.-  AX_ChooseOrdBagExt( ".CDX" )    //de .IDX a .CDX, para igualar a DBFCDX
DAMC>    Advantage use ".IDX" as index extension default
DAMC>    Clipper       use ".CDX" as index extension default (or fixed?)
This depends on index type. CDX is used for multi-bag, idx for single

DAMC> f.-   AX_MemoArrayStyle( "FlexFile" )  //Igualar a DBFCDX
DAMC>   Advantage manage formats "FlexFile" and "Six", and use "Six" as default
DAMC>   Clipper only manage "FlexFile"
This won't happen in Harbour unless someone wants to hack the FlexFile
formats. Current ACE32 docs don't say anything about "Six" array
support.  I created my own arrayToString functions and converted my
stored arrays. The Remote Server doesn't know anything about Harbour
Array structures. Then there are the issues of whether Type(memofield)
returns "A" or not. I recommend biting the bullet on this one and
converting.

DAMC> Observations:
DAMC> 1.- This is an question
DAMC>   Are the functions mentionated in Advantage RDD for Clipper, included in
DAMC> ADS support in Harbour ?
DAMC>   By example:  AX_SetMemoBlock( 64 ),  AX_ChooseOrdBagExt( ".CDX" ),
DAMC> AX_MemoArrayStyle( "FlexFile" )
There are no ax* functions in Harbour. There are some ads* functions
in adsfunc.c and ads1.c (most are documented, but not all).
BUT my intention with the changes I've made to
rddads is to integrate features as much as
possible with the 5.3 rdd calls so the rdd is truly replaceable with
dbfcdx.  Ideally, no other function calls are needed, although there
are special features in ads that aren't generalized in the rdd
(encryption, etc.)

DAMC> 2.- In Harbour DBFCDX, do not forget to review the Clipper compatibility in
DAMC> the proper commands:
DAMC> SET AUTOPEN     Sets/Gets automatic open mode.  When a production index is
DAMC>                 attached to a data file, when that data file is USEd, the
DAMC>                 index is open automatically.  Setting AUTOPEN off will not
DAMC>                 open the production index file.
In ads, you cannot turn this off. Structural indexes are always opened
and cannot be closed.

DAMC> SET AUTORDER    Allows control of the master index which is in effect when a
DAMC>                 production index is used.  Setting the order to 0, orders the
DAMC>                 database in natural order while setting the order to 1, sets
DAMC>                 the first index to the active index.
This could happen.

DAMC> SET AUTOSHARE   Autoshare allows the CDX driver to automatically open the
DAMC>                 index in exclusive mode if not running on the network and in
DAMC>                 SHARED mode if running on a network.
This one's not likely. Let me know if there's any indication of such
capability in ace32, I couldn't find it.

 HTH

It's available now! That is, it's available for C modules. You don't
need it for any PRG modules, do you?

See doc/en/hb_set.txt for the documentation and source/rtl/set.c for a
commented out example of how to use it (it's what I used for testing).

Should be:
char szBuffer[6]; // without the '*'

but take care of sizes in the buffer or you could get an overflow.
The numbers you 'sprintf' may be 2 digits and so the total string will be 6
+ 1 (for the \0) = 7 !

Also if you want to have fixed lenght strings you could use the format
string "%2.2n:%2.2n\n".

Horacio

Maurilio,

Lets go now for a very basic PRG code:

function Main()

   local oForm := TForm():New()

   oForm:ShowModal()

return nil

That is my idea about a generic Class TForm
for Harbour, that may run on any operating
system. Doing it that way, we hide the 
specific requirements of each operating system.

Maurilio,

Lets try the following code:
(hopefully it may works :-)

TFORM.PRG

#include "hbclass.ch"
#include "os2pm.ch"   // Needed to store some OS/2 PM constant values

CLASS TForm

   DATA      hWnd

   CLASSDATA lRegistered

   METHOD    New()

   METHOD    ShowModal()

ENDCLASS

   local hWndClient

   DEFAULT ::lRegistered TO .f.

   if ! ::lRegistered

      // Notice that this code may be moved to a method Register()
      // so we hide again the OS API details

      WinRegisterClass( "HB_TFORM",;
                        nOr( CS_SIZEREDRAW, 0x2000001 ), 0 )
      ::lRegistered = .t.
   endif

   // Again this code may be moved to a method Create() to hide the
   // OS API details

   ::hWnd = WinCreateStdWindow( HWND_DESKTOP,;
                                WS_VISIBLE,;
                                nOr( FCF_TITLEBAR, FCF_SYSMENU,;
                                FCF_SIZEBORDER, FCF_TASKLIST,;
                                FCF_MINMAX, FCF_SHELLPOSITION ),;
                                "HB_TFORM", "Harbour TForm",;

                                @hWndClient ) // Not used yet

return Self

METHOD ShowModal() CLASS TForm

   HB_PM_ShowModal()

return nil


Now we need a os2pm.c module with the wrappers
to the OS2 PM functions:

#define INCL_BASE
#define INCL_WIN
#define INCL_GPI

#include <os2.h>
#include "hbapi.h"

HAB hb_pm_GetHab( void );

HB_FUNC( WINREGISTERCLASS )
{

   hb_retl( WinRegisterClass( hb_pm_GetHab(),   /* anchor block handle */
                              hb_parc( 1 ),     /* Class Name */
                              ( PFNWP ) WinDefWindowProc,  /* default Class

                              hb_parnl( 2 ),     /* style */
                              hb_parnl( 3 ) ) ); /* extra bytes */
}

HB_FUNC( WINCREATESTDWINDOW )
{
   ULONG lFrame = hb_parnl( 3 );
   HWND hWndClient, hWndFrame;

   hb_retnl( ( LONG ) hWndFrame =
             WinCreateStdWindow( ( HWND ) hb_parnl( 1 ), /* hWndParent */
                                 hb_parnl( 2 ), /* style */
                                 &lFrame,       /* lFrame */
                                 hb_parc( 4 ),  /* cClassName */
                                 hb_parc( 5 ),  /* cCaption */

Might I suggest that something be done to "namespace" such classes? I'd
imagine that TForm would be a very common class name amongst OO coding
Clipper programmers.

It is a good suggestion, but I don't think it will
be needed in the future. I explain why:

Later on, all forms will inherit from TForm, so they
may be named Class TForm1, TForm2, or TWhatEver. 

Besides that, Harbour (as Clipper) provides a Class TBrowse,
and there seems no need to name it as HB_TBrowse.

If we turn Class TForm into a Harbour standard, then I don't
think that will be a big problem.

What do you think about creating

Is that possible ?

I know it's early days yet but I was thinking about how this would pan out.
>From what's been said so far it would appear that there is some interest in
designing a cross platform GUI framework, if only a high level approach (as
we all know, each platform has it's own unique ideas of what form part of a
"GUI").

So, in an idle moment, I was wondering about the design of this. Is the idea
that it would be designed kind of like the GT libraries? That is, a common
interface which is implemented in various libraries (one for Win32, one for
OS/2 PM, one for KDE, one for GTK+, one for Tk, one for Motif, one for...)?

Given this I was wondering if it might be an idea to map out some of the top
level classes (if only the form class for a moment) and implement it as an
abstract class. That way anyone wishing to have a crack at writing support
for their environment can give some thought, and input, into what the
interface of that abstract class would look like.

I'm thinking about this sort of thing (HGF == Harbour GUI Framework):

  rtl/hgf/absform.prg     - Includes HB_TAbstractForm()

  rtl/hgf/win32/form.prg  - HB_TForm() inherits from HB_TAbstractForm()
  rtl/hgf/os2pm/form.prg  - HB_TForm() inherits from HB_TAbstractForm()
  rtl/hgf/kde/form.prg    - HB_TForm() inherits from HB_TAbstractForm()
  rtl/hgf/gtk/form.prg    - HB_TForm() inherits from HB_TAbstractForm()
  ... and so on

This way there's a known interface that has to be implemented within each
GUI implementation library.

The reason I raise this so early is that it's my understanding that some GUI
systems work quite different from others and this might need to be taken
into account at the abstract level. For example, Win32, OS/2 and the Palm
GUI (to name three that I've had experience with) are all very much the
same. On the other hand, GTK is quite different because it employs callbacks
rather than using a central message cracker.

I was also thinking that HB_NOR() and friends might be useful (when
correctly namespaced) as part of the RTL proper.

I guess it's possible, but, as I said the other day, it's not so much a case
of creating a "Linux GUI" application entry point, it's more a case of
creating GUI entry points for someone's "widget set" of choice. The common
libraries for this sort of thing these days are, as you know, GTK and KDE.

In the unlikely event that I get some free time to play with this I'm
thinking that this is the perfect excuse for me to get back into GTK
programming (I've dabbled with KDE and GTK but never had the need to do
anything serious). Not that this should put off anyone with more time and
more need for this than I.

Perhaps you've missed the thrust of my point? I'm thinking about existing
Clipper code for programmers that do OO. TForm would seem to be quite an
obvious and common name for all sorts of uses and anything we can do to keep
the namespace as wide as possible has to be a good thing.

Put another way, it doesn't hurt for us to add a prefix to help make the
namespace wider does it? It might hurt someone if we don't.

> Besides that, Harbour (as Clipper) provides a Class TBrowse, and there

That's something entirely different. We're implementing a Clipper compatible
compiler and RTL so obviously we didn't need to do that. However, there is a
standard rule in harbour that if we add a new symbol to the RTL it should be
prefixed so as to place it well and truely within the HB_ namespace. That
way anyone using harbour knows that the number of symbol clashes are reduced
and that they've only got problems if their code contains symbols that are
prefixed with HB_.

This is what I'm getting at, if we're going to create a standard we should
be environmentally friendly about it. We should namespace those standard
names. It doesn't cost us anything but it does deliver benefits.

Yes, as they are used a lot of times, when
it comes to manage GUIs constant values,

(I don't like so many HB_ around, but... :-)

I guess that even those "widget sets", may have a common entry

Doesn't Linux provide a standard -basic- way to show a MsgInfo()

I know, but HB_TForm is uggly compared with TForm :-(

How many of us have a Class TForm ?  (well FW has it :-)))

Both Microsoft and Borland use the term "form",
so that is why I vote for a Harbour TForm.

Anyhow, the name is not the main thing...

Instead of HB_TForm, I'd go with THBForm, or THBGForm, or even 
THarbourForm.

Also, I think Borland have come pretty close to the mark with the VCL when 
it comes to application frameworks (I haven't seen Kylix's CLX, but I 
assume it's even better) . . . perhaps it's worth emulating that to some 
degree?

Dave's directory proposal looks excellent! :-)

  rtl/hgf/os2pm/os2pm.c

and tests/TestForm.prg for the little sample,

  THarbourForm looks nice. It is a long name, but

I noticed it in the name, but not in the execution (the code snippet you 
posted before). For example, the VCL's TForm isn't a base class - it's 
derived from TWinControl (or something like that). It makes sense this 
way, since windows are controls, too. I'm pretty sure this holds in most 
of the GUIs around today (considering MS just ripped-off the existing ones 
of the time when they created the Windows API).

Perhaps it's necessary to derive a THarbourControl from TObject, and build 
off that?

But utility counts for more than beauty here doesn't it?

That's an impossible question to answer, which is why I raised the issue int
he first place. Not to mention that it's a long standing "standard" that
when adding new symbols to harbour's RTL, wherever possible, we prefix them.

> Anyhow, the name is not the main thing... 

Agreed, I never suggested it was, but it's worth ironing out any obvious
wrinkles as early as possible and using up the namespace without a prefix
seems to be one such wrinkle.

Mabster,

I don't believe we may need use exactly the same VCL 
hierarchy. Just the overall architecture and its way of work.

All controls are specialized windows, so its
easier to inherit a THarbourControl from a THarbourForm.

Anyhow, once we have a basic working model, we
may refine it more and more.

The target now it should be that we all get a clear
understanding about how we are building the Harbour GUI
layer.

So on this stage, the simplest we keep it, the better :-)

Any of those would be fine, as long as there's some standard unique(ish)

I won't claim to have much knowledge of CLX yet as my playing with kylix had
to take a back seat due to other demands on my time. However, from what I've
seen so far it's not that different from the VCL (it can't be, that would
make porting apps from VLC to CLX quick, tricky).

Sure they do, that's my point.

But you seem to have missed my point. Asking if Linux as a function for
placing a message box on a GUI makes no sense. Linux is a kernel. Even if we
take the wider meaning of Linux (AKA GNU/Linux), the one that means a whole
operating system, the GUI isn't embedded in the operating system, it's an
optional extra that works on top of the OS. Hence the reason that the GUI
that is commonly used (The X Window System) has been ported to other
operating systems (Win32, OS/2, ...).

It's the "widget sets" that provide this sort of thing and very few, if any,
of these widget sets have anything to do with Linux itself. The likes of
KDE, GTK, Tk, Motif, etc.. are generally cross platform.

So, in answer to your question, no, it doesn't.

I am pretty sure we may organize the GTK messages
mapping into a much better and simpler way. 

Once we start reviewing how to map GUI messages from
the Harbour GUI layer, you will see how GTK management
will look really different and much simpler.

Probably we may just need now something like this:

Linux GTK application entry point proposal:

int main( int argc, char * argv[] )
{
   gtk_init( &argc, &argv );

   hb_cmdargInit( argc, argv );
   hb_vmInit( TRUE );
   hb_vmQuit();   

   gtk_main_quit();

   return 0;
}

Ok, I see. (though I assume the kernel may provide 
some API functions to turn from console mode to graphical 
mode).

Anyhow, we may start using the GTK. That may not
be a problem.

We may just create a Class THarbourNonVisualControl(), without
inheriting it from THarbourForm().

Excellent point, except that off the cuff I can't think of a "non-visual 
control". Perhaps the notion of shortcut keys etc could be considered 
"controls"?

Also, the VCL derives TWinControl from TControl, which means that 
non-windowed controls (ie controls that can't get focus, like the buttons 
in the caption of a form) are supported too.

I think there are countless workarounds you could employ, but to be honest 
the best thing to do now (before the coding really starts) is sit down and 
draw up a really detailed plan of the class heirarchy. The framework 
you're imagining will be great for RAD, but you can't use RAD paradigms to 
create it - it'll have to be done the hard way :)

That said, I'll be happy to discuss the heirarchy itself and lend my 
opinions whether or not they're asked for :)

Depends, what sort of thing do you have in mind? The window/full-screen
thing that you get in OS/2 and Windows? No, there's nothing like that. X
runs in a console, just like other virtual consoles.

Or did you have something else in mind?

That would then make enumerating controls on a form just a little harder
than is required.

All opinions and help are welcome.

I am just helping Maurilio to build a OS/2 PM GUI,
and in the meantime, using that effort, I want to set 
the foundation for a Harbour multiplatform Class TForm. 

Also, with Dave and others Linux users cooperation, 
we may check if that model is ok for Linux too.

The VCL is chock full of non-visual controls (think of TTimer, TMainMenu,
TPopupMenu, any of the dialog controls or many of the database oriented
controls for example). Moreover, programmers themselves write lots of
non-visual controls. A large class hierarchy that I've written for Delphi
has lots of non-visual controls in it that allow other programmers to
drag/drop an application without the need to actually write any code.

I'd say that well over half of the controls in that library are non-visual.

Hello Antonio,

Some time ago I started writing an XBase++ library (with Harbour
in mind) which is an XBase OO layer for GTK (currently it
uses XBase++ and GTK+ for Windows, but sure I want it to compile with
Harbour and GTK/Linux). For now, about 1/3 of all GTK objects are
implemented.

Maybe we should start a sourceforge group for this library so that
other people can take part in development?

This is the sample hello.prg:

/* -*- mode: xpp -*- example-start helloworld helloworld.prg */
#include "gtk.ch"

#ifdef __HARBOUR__
#define PValue __PValue
#endif


INIT PROCEDURE gtkinit(par)
  LOCAL aPar:={}
  FOR i:=1 TO PCount()
    AAdd(aPar, PValue(i))
  NEXT
  /* This is called in all GTK applications. Arguments are parsed
   * from the command line and are returned to the application. */
  gtk_init(Len(aPar), aPar)
RETURN
  
FUNCTION main
  LOCAL oWindow, oButton, oBox1
  PUBLIC stop:=.F.

  gdk_threads_enter()
  
  /* create a new window */
  oWindow = GtkWindow():new()
  oWindow:set_title("Hello buttons!")
    
  /* When the window (GtkObject) is given the "delete_event" signal (this is given
   * by the window manager, usually by the "close" option, or on the
   * titlebar), we ask it to run a code block. */
    /* If you return .F. in the "delete_event" signal handler,
     * GTK will emit the "destroy" signal. Returning .T. means
     * you don't want the window to be destroyed.
     * This is useful for popping up 'are you sure you want to quit?'
     * type dialogs. */
  oWindow:signal_connect("delete_event", {|o,e| gtk_main_quit(), .F. })
    
  /* Sets the border width of the window (GtkContainer). */
  oWindow:set_border_width(10)
  
  /* We create a box to pack widgets into.  This is described in detail
   * in the "packing" section. The box is not really visible, it
   * is just used as a tool to arrange widgets. */
  oBox1 = GtkHBox():new(.F., 0)
  oWindow:add(oBox1)
    
  /* Creates a new button with the label "Hello World". */
  oButton = GtkButton():new("Button1")
  
  /* When the button receives the "clicked" signal, it will call the
   * specified code block. */
  oButton:signal_connect("clicked", {|o| g_print("hello ") })
  
  /* Instead of gtk_container_add, we pack this button into the invisible
   * box, which has been packed into the window. */
  oBox1:pack_start(oButton, .T., .T., 0)

  oButton = GtkButton():new("Button 2")
  oButton:signal_connect("clicked", {|o| g_print("hello2 "), o:destroy() })
  oBox1:pack_start(oButton, .T., .T., 0)
    
  /* The final step is to display this newly created widgets and the window. */
  oWindow:show_all()
  
  /* All GTK applications must have a gtk_main(). Control ends here and waits
  * for an event to occur (like a key press or mouse event). */
  gtk_main()
  gdk_threads_leave()
  RETURN 0
/* example-end */

I am just looking for an easy and quick sample to check
if the proposed Harbour Linux GTK entry point may work or not.

GtkWidget * gtk_input_dialog_new( void );

seems something easy to test, though it is not exactly
a MessageBox() alike function.

But that is a totally different concept.

Those non-visual controls are in fact visual controls
(i.e. you see them, you can click, drag, delete them,
I mean from the builder itself).

But later on, when the app is running, the builder does
not create visual controls for them.

Anyhow, those non visual controls are specifically 
managed and created by the builder (the visual IDE),
so there is no point to care about them now. And
just one Class will be enough to support them.

Antonio,

since we (as harbour developers) don't have a clear idea about a harbour
gui framework (and you and me are trying to make FiveWin/2 run again) I
will create a subdir inside contrib (contrib/os2pm) and I will put
everything there.

If and when there will be a harbour GUI class hierarchy we will move
things where they most fit.

regards.

Phil,

Your help on the GTK issues may be very important here.
Many thanks in advance! :-)

I have reviewed your GTK proposal, but I have a
different approach on mind. I am not saying yours is
wrong. Yours is API based, so the programmers needs
to know GTK, and that is what we want to hide :-)

We do want to have a multiplatform Class THarbourForm
that may run on any GUI without having to change the
application source code.

Just a first question :-)

Is there a Windows MessageBox() alike function on GTK ?
We want to check if we have a valid Linux GTK entry point.

I am sure we may use a lot of portions and feedback
from your source code, if you agree.

thanks again,

Antonio

Ah. This is just a terminology thing. I think of things like TTimer as 
just "components", rather than "non-visual controls". A "control" to me 
*means* that it's visual.

TMenu and TPopupMenu, however, walk a fine line between "non-visual" and 
"visual" when you think about it. Dialogs, too.

But this is all academic if Antonio wants to forge ahead with his original 
design.

My suggestion:

TObject
  THarbourControl
    THarbourWinControl
      THarbourForm (or maybe THarbourWindow)
      THarbourButton
      THarbourEdit
      etc etc
    THarbourMainMenu
    THarbourTimer
    THarbourToolbar
    THarbourToolButton
    THarbourStatusBar
    THarbourDialog
      THarbourOpenDialog
      THarbourSaveDialog
      THarbourPrintDialog
      etc etc

And of course you'd have to build into this the same sort of features the 
VCL has, such as Persistance and the neat Event mechanism (or maybe a 
smarter "publish and subscribe" mechanism like JBuilder's component 
library).

This sort of thing (Delphi code, more or less):

begin
  for i := 0 to MainForm.ComponentCount - 1 do
  begin
    if MainForm.Components[i].ClassNameIs('TForm') then
      {...}
    else if MainForm.Components[i].ClassNameIs('TMenu') then
      {...}
  end;
end;

Mab

It really doesn't matter - threads can be switched off. On the other
hand, I hope that some day harbour will become MT/threadsafe.

This is what i borrowed from GTK 1.3(unstable) reference. The stable
version 1.2 doesn't support it:

 dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (main_application_window,
                                  GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,
                                  GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                  GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                  "Error loading file 's': s",
                                  filename, g_strerror (errno));
 response = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
 gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);

Maurilio,

Well, that is not exactly what we are doing.

My idea is to move a step ahead and implement
a Harbour multiplatform Class THarbourForm, that
may work for different operating systems GUIs
without source code changes.

This is just another approach - you're creating a totally new API
while i am using an existing one. GTK is portable too.

See my another message.

Of course i agree but i have to find some place on the Net to put it
to.

Mabster,

I agree. But again, I insist that "components" are just
classes to be used by the "builder". Now we are at a source
code level, not at an automatic builder level.

All Harbour objects automatically inherit from Harbour TObject.
So we already have that. Your hierarchy proposal seems ok to me.

Harbour will have a wonderfull and incredible simple
"persistance" technology, but that is something I will keep
secret by now ;-)

Same for Harbour. Why not ? :-)

Mab,

Class THarbourForm may have a aControls and
a aComponents arrays. That simple! :-)

for n = 1 to MainForm:nComponentCount
   if MainForm:aComponents[ n ]:ClassName() == "TForm"
      ...
   else
      ...
next

Have you used any of the MS Window's Enum functions? Similar to that sort of
thing. 

IOW looping over all the siblings of a control and doing something with
them. If the class hierarchy is constructed well it makes filtering the
items you enumerate quite easy.

To illustrate, here's a little function I use a lot when doing component
work in Delphi:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
Function FindFirstComponentOfType( AClass : TComponentClass; oWhere : TComponent ) : TComponent;
Var
  i : Integer;
Begin

  // Nil is the result if nothing is found.
  Result := Nil;

  // Loop thru all the child components of oWhere...
  For i := 0 To oWhere.ComponentCount - 1 Do
    // ...is this of the right kind of class?
    If oWhere.Components[ i ] Is AClass Then
    Begin
      // It is, return it.
      Result := oWhere.Components[ i ];
      Break;
    End;

End;
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

If the hierarchy goes from least specific to most specific (non-visual to
visual in the case of this discussion) then it makes things like the above
work well.

Different from what? The point here is that there's a common ancestor of all
types of "controls". That's something that VCL has. For example, in VCL a
TForm inherits from a TCustomForm which inherits via a couple of other
levels. from TComponent (which is where non visual controls inherit from).

Except when you instantiate them at run-time, but that's beside the point.
The point here is that the various non-visual controls inherit from
TComponent, as does (for example) TForm. All types of control, visual and
non-visual, have a common ancestor. That's what the mabster was getting at.

Those controls aren't specifically created by the builder, not in Delphi
anyway. They're as much under my control as they are under the control of
Delphi's IDE.

Apologies, I was trying to keep away from Delphi terminology to keep things
as generic as possible but I guess I've confused the Delphi hackers now? <g>

My point was, as you'll probably agree, that there are "controls" that
actually take up space on a form (visual controls) and there are controls
that don't (non-visual controls, AKA components in Delphi speak). What we
both seem to agree on is that "non-visual" is the parent of "visual". As per
VCL. Yeah?

Yeah, that's exactly the sort of thing I had in mind too. Note that we'd
probably want to be inserting some abstract classes in there too as the
anchor points for the platform specific splits (see my other email about
that).

So maybe we shouldn't use it (Dave?)

I don't have a Linux here, but I guess this
code may work (based on your sample):

   GtkWidget * dlg = gtk_input_dialog_new();

   gtk_dialog_run( GTK_DIALOG( dlg ) )

   gtk_widget_destroy( dlg );


What do you think ?

Antonio,

I fear that creating a new GUI framework will require much more time and
forces than we have available at the moment.

FiveWin/2 should require a lot less work since it was already running a
few years ago and PM api didn't change that much over these years.

regards.

PS. On the contrary a small, multiplatform, base GUI framework could help
porting FiveWin to linux, I see your point :-)

That is fine. What is the problem ? We can move the hierarchy
methods up and down, or include new classes. Are we going to
get stoped until we get a 100% perfect vision ? Then we will
never get it.

I know you can create them at run-time...

IMO, Harbour should follow its _own_ GUI layer design.

That will provide us all the freedom we may need.

You're both missing a key point here because you're both testing class
names. Often you want to enumerate classes based on their capability, not
their names. Capability is tested by checking that a class is of or is
descended from a certain type.

This is why getting the inheritance tree "just so" is important. This is why
it would be normal to have (for example) a Form, a "non-visual control" and
some other control have a common ancestor, it lets the programmer filter the
enumeration at any level they wish.

I am going to donate most of its code (FiveOS2),

Don't worry about it.

Believe me if I tell you I am not thinking about FiveWin here.
I am caring about Harbour. Harbour needs a powerfull GUI layer :-)

I don't have any plans for a FiveWin for Linux. I promise.

Well, there is such reason as cross-platform portability (i have
no XBase on Unix or Mac), but this is not the real reason.
The real reason is GTK's open-sourceness. XBaseParts don't have such
enhanced functionality as GTK has, and I can not enhance them.

We're writing (converting to GUI from old Clipper code) a
clipper-based DBMS for comparative linguistics. Databases we're using
contain a lot of text in mixed languages, encodings and scripts.
What we really need from GTK (unavailable in XBParts) is GtkText
 - a formatted multifont text editor control. Currently we're using
 standard windows RichEdit control, but it is awfully buggy,
 non-portable to other platforms and non-extendable.

There is no problem, this is a discussion that allows various parties to
understand and reach consensus. The only "problem", if there was one at all,
is that you seemed to have a different view from what the mabster and I were
talking about so we've been discussing the various designs and our
respective experiences so we can know where we're coming from and going to.

That's the opposite of a problem IMO.

I don't think anyone is stopping anything or anyone else. Please don't
suggest that people who are interested in the design are trying to stop
anything, that's not my motivation and I seriously doubt it's the mabsters'
either.

Did anyone stop anything because people were discussing the design?

Antonio,

rest assured that I don't see as "bad" a FiveWin for Linux!

And a single GUI layer (FiveWin) available on three different platforms (Win32,
Linux and OS/2) will give a lot of freedom to anyone writing programs with
harbour.

regards.

Dave,

> Did anyone stop anything because people were discussing the design ?

yes, you are right.

My point is that once we get some basic functionality,
we will all have a better point of view.

Antonio,

I'll do it in minutes

regards.

PS. I took os2.h and moved all #define to os2pm.ch so os2pm.ch is a mess
right now... but it works :-))

Maurilio,

Soon we will change its window procedure, 
and it will start routing messages properly :-)

Maurilio,

Lets add these two methods to get a feeling
how to manage properties a la Delphi :-)

   // Should we call it "Caption" only ?

   METHOD cCaption() INLINE WinGetText( ::hWnd ) 

   METHOD _cCaption( cNewCaption ) INLINE ;
                    WinSetWindowText( ::hWnd, cNewCaption )

...

HB_FUNC( WINSETWINDOWTEXT )
{
   hb_retl( WinSetWindowText( ( HWND ) hb_parnl( 1 ), hb_parc( 2 ) ) );
}

HB_FUNC( WINGETTEXT )
{
   BYTE bBuffer[ 255 ];

   WinQueryWindowText( ( HWND ) hb_parnl( 1 ), 254, bBuffer );
   hb_retc( bBuffer );
}

Now you may enhance the little sample:

function Main()

   local oForm := TForm():New()

   oForm:cCaption = "Hello World!"

   MsgInfo( oForm:cCaption )

   oForm:ShowModal()

return nil


BTW, I would propose to change DATA hWnd into DATA Handle,
as on other GUIs we may be talking about "handles" (widgets, and
so on) instead of "windows" :-)

Definitely. Both visual and non-visual "controls" share common attributes 
that don't appear in TObject (an "owner" object, for example - so that a 
menu is free'd when it's window is), so it doesn't make sense to only 
derive them from TObject - there should be an intemediary class like 
THarbourControl (as I outlined in my example heirarchy). Hmm . . . this 
makes it sound like I'm arguing with you, Dave - I'm not. I'm simply 
reiterating what we both believe.

Yep. Like the VCL's TCustomControl etc.

To be fair, the ClassNameIs method is identical to the "is" keyword that 
you used in your example, Dave.

I guess my example doesn't really demonstrate what you're talking about, 
though, since it draws a distinction between classes lower in the 
heirarchy, rather than looking for, say, components which derive from 
TControl.

On this we could not agree more.

Of course it is! Didn't you know I'm a mole? :)

I was sent from the future to prevent the creation of Harbour, since it's 
GUI abstraction layer forms the front-end for a computer which takes over 
the world in 2023.

You may move HB_FUNC( MSGINFO ) 
from mainpm.c to os2pm.c

Yes. :-(  Almost always shows non-OO (or bad OO).

It's probably better to use something like Java's interfaces.  Your
use of the word "capability" very much points to that. :-)

In case anyone isn't familiar with the idea of an interface, it's
where you state the (publicly visible) messages needed/provided by
something.  (If you know about "design by contract" this should look
familiar.)

This means that if object oSender expects interface iXXX to be
implemented by an object, then oSender can send messages to any
objects which implement iXXX.  Those objects may or may not be in the
same inheritance hierarchy (it doesn't matter).

Dave et al,

The idea to be careful about namespace issues looks right.

What is the T for in e.g. HB_TAbstractForm?  Borland's Delphi uses T
as a prefix; MFC uses C.  Would make sense for Harbour to use some
other letter (or none). :-)

BTW, Clip-4-Win uses W (not quite always, but let's not get into
that!), so please have Harbour not use W. :-)

So this could run on Win32, OS/2, Linux, etc..

DEFINE DIALOG oDlg FROM 1,1 TO 12,20 TITLE "Hello"
@ 1,2 SAY "This is a test"
ACTIVATE DIALOG oDlg CENTER

Antonio:

  Borland adopted the standard for a "T" to preface their class names,
  and Microsoft "C".   If you stick with T, you're very likely to
  collide with others adopting the Borland way.
  As I see it, Borland's whole point was to use "T" for _Their_ stuff,
  and let the programmer design his own class names differently.

  What is special about a T for Harbour ?????? It is meaningless.

  So why not HForm, HWidget etc. (if hb_ is too ugly) and we can claim
  1/26th of the worldwide namespaces just like the big boys?

Excuse me, but I though that the T before a class name means "Type"... !?
Yes and its true, Microsoft uses a "C" before the class name. Also if we will use longer names than 10 chars, I proposed "cls". What do you think ?

Message-ID: <000001c12cd8$7538cf60$0f2aa8c0@first>

Maurilio,

Lets place a menu on the form:
(notice I have not tested this code
as it is here, but hopefully it may work :-)

menu.prg

#include "hbclass.ch"

CLASS TMenu

   DATA   nHandle
   DATA   aItems

   METHOD New( oForm )
   METHOD Add( oMenuItem )

ENDCLASS

METHOD New( oForm ) CLASS TMenu

   ::aItems  = {}
   ::nHandle = WinCreateMenu( oForm:hWnd )

return Self

METHOD Add( oMenuItem ) CLASS TMenu

   WinAddMenuItem( ::nHandle, oMenuItem:cCaption, Len( ::aItems ),;
                   nil, oMenuItem:nId, oMenuItem:lActive )

   AAdd( ::aItems, oMenuItem )

return nil

We also need a menuitem.prg:

#include "hbclass.ch"

CLASS TMenuItem

   DATA   cCaption
   DATA   cAction
   DATA   nId
   DATA   lActive

   CLASSDATA nIdStart

   METHOD New()

ENDCLASS

METHOD New() CLASS TMenuItem

   DEFAULT :nIdStart TO 110

   ::cCaption = ""
   ::nId      = ::nIdStart++
   ::lActive  = .t.

return Self

And finally we need these new code on class TForm:

   DATA     oMainMenu

   METHOD   oMenu() INLINE ::oMainMenu
   METHOD   _oMenu( oNewMenu )

METHOD _oMenu( oNewMenu ) CLASS TForm

   ::oMainMenu = oNewMenu

   WinSetParent( oNewMenu:nHandle, ::hWnd, .t. )
   WinSetOwner( oNewMenu:nHandle, ::hWnd )
   WinSendMsg( ::hWnd, WM_UPDATEFRAME, FCF_MENU, 0 )

return nil

So now, on our little sample we may do:

function Main()

Maurilio,

> And presto!!

Cool! We are having luck ;-)

Lets try to add some more menuitems:

function Main()

   local oForm := TForm():New()
   local oMenu := TMenu():New( oForm )
   local oMenuItem1, oMenuItem2, oMenuItem3

   oForm:cCaption = "Hello World!"

   oMenuItem1 = TMenuItem():New()
   oMenuItem1:cCaption = "One"
   oMenu:Add( oMenuItem1 )

   oMenuItem2 = TMenuItem():New()
   oMenuItem2:cCaption = "Two"
   oMenu:Add( oMenuItem2 )

   oMenuItem3 = TMenuItem():New()
   oMenuItem3:cCaption = "Three"
   oMenu:Add( oMenuItem3 )

   oForm:oMenu = oMenu

   oForm:ShowModal()

return nil

Many thanks for your cooperation,

Antonio

Shit. Well there you go. I deliberately used "ClassNameIs" in my example, 
because I thought using the "is" operator would be confusing for 
non-delphi people. What am I thinking of? Is there a DescendsFrom method 
or something?

John,

I was going to cite interfaces as an example, but then realised that 
they're actually an argument *against* properly structure class 
heirarchies. Why? Because an interface can be "injected" into *any* class, 
regardless of what it descends from. We could simply have every single 
class descend from TObject, and implement an "IWinControl" interface.

So while interfaces are great, they're not helping our cause :-)

Problem there is that many people use things like HWidget to represent the 
"Handle" to a widget (a standard Microsoft use a lot) so that's not the 
answer either.

I like TForm, but then I'm a Borland guy from way back, so it's kind of 
in-grained. :-)

Maurilio,

Lets do some changes on Class TMenuItem to
allow to add some pulldown menuitems:
(I am not sure if it may works as expected,
but we may get quite closer)

#include "common.ch"
#include "hbclass.ch"

CLASS TMenuItem

   DATA   cCaption  // Specifies the text of the menu item
   DATA   cAction   // A character description of the method to invoke
   DATA   nId       // Command value to send to the container form
   DATA   lEnabled  // Specifies whether the menu item is enabled
   DATA   aItems    // Contains the menu items in the submenu of the menu
item
   DATA   oParent   // Identifies the parent menu item of this menu item
   DATA   nHandle   // The handle of the submenu of this menu item

   CLASSDATA nIdStart   // start value for commands value to assign to menu
items

   METHOD New( oOwner ) // Creates a new menu item
   METHOD Add( oMenuItem ) // Adds a new drop down menu item

ENDCLASS

METHOD New( oOwner ) CLASS TMenuItem

   DEFAULT ::nIdStart TO 110

   ::cCaption = ""
   ::nId      = ::nIdStart++
   ::lEnabled = .t.
   ::oParent  = oOwner

return Self

METHOD Add( oMenuItem ) CLASS TMenuItem

   DEFAULT ::aItems  TO {}
   DEFAULT ::nHandle TO WinCreateMenu( ::oParent:nHandle )

   WinAddMenuItem( ::nHandle, oMenuItem:cCaption, Len( ::aItems ),;
                   ::oParent:nHandle, oMenuItem:nId, oMenuItem:lEnabled )

   AAdd( ::aItems, oMenuItem )

return nil


Please notice this method also changes:

METHOD Add( oMenuItem ) CLASS TMenu

   WinAddMenuItem( ::nHandle, oMenuItem:cCaption, Len( ::aItems ),;
                   nil, oMenuItem:nId, oMenuItem:lEnabled )

   AAdd( ::aItems, oMenuItem )

return nil


And now, our little sample may be like this:

function Main()

   local oForm := TForm():New()
   local oMenu := TMenu():New( oForm )
   local oMenuItem1, oMenuItem2, oMenuItem3
   local oSubItem1, oSubItem2

   oForm:cCaption = "Hello World!"

   oMenuItem1 = TMenuItem():New( oMenu )
   oMenuItem1:cCaption = "One"
   oMenu:Add( oMenuItem1 )

   oSubItem1 = TMenuItem():New( oMenuItem1 )
   oSubItem1.cCaption = "Hello"
   oMenuItem1.Add( oSubItem1 )

   oSubItem2 = TMenuItem():New( oMenuItem1 )
   oSubItem2.cCaption = "Bye"
   oMenuItem1.Add( oSubItem2 )

   oMenuItem2 = TMenuItem():New( oMenu )
   oMenuItem2:cCaption = "Two"
   oMenu:Add( oMenuItem2 )

   oMenuItem3 = TMenuItem():New( oMenu )
   oMenuItem3:cCaption = "Three"
   oMenu:Add( oMenuItem3 )

   oForm:oMenu = oMenu

   oForm:ShowModal()

return nil


Thanks for your help,

OK, you refer only to RDDADS
And before you explained me about how RDD Advantage for Clipper are
specific and in some cases more complete than ACE32.dll, which is more generic

Maybe  Advantage-ACE32.dll use the locking scheme of FoxPro, and in those
case the Clipper/DBFCDX programs must include CDXLOCK.obj, in order to
share "locking" with Harbour/DBFCDX - RDDADS - FoxPro

David G. Holm gave the good notice.

Yes I know it
CLIP53a.txt say:
   "The file extensions that will be created when using the CDX driver are

Which will be the default for Harbour/DBFCDX, if it will support .idx files ?

And how will manage Harbour it ? Clipper do it in some specific way: type
"FlexFile". As I understand, the type is stored in some place in database file
Will be included in Harbour some equivalent to store/retrieve arrays in
Memo files, as you did for your needs ? And in that case we may "forget"
types "Six" and "FlexFile". Your arrayToString functions can be the choice ?
That could used as generic functions for all RDD: DBFNTX(?); DBFCDX, RDDADS
Something as:  MemoArrayPut( memofield, aArray ), MemoArrayGet( memofield )

But, as I understand, if RDD Advantage for Clipper or Clipper DBFCDX are
storing an type "Array" value in an type memo field , they put the style
"Six" or "FlexFile" in the memo field, in order to determine the style when
will retrieve the array
In such case can work this, as NG Advantage for Clipper say:
-  PUT:  test->memofield := {{ 1, "hi there", .T. }, { .F., 3.14159 }}
  // This array data will be written to the FPT memo file using
  //   the FlexFile syntax                     <--- if FlexFile is the
active style
-  GET:  aArrayData := test->memofield
  // This will read the array data stored in the FPT memo file no
  // matter which "style" was used when it was written.

Maybe Harbour DBFCDX should have an verification of the value type when
storing/retrieving values in memo fields
PUT: If value is an array, store "style" used plus array values
GET: If exist style value, assume an array type and read/return the array

The DBFCDX developers must see which will be the better approach to have
Clipper compatibility

I see how Antonio is working hard and so fast, in order to develop an
"Harbour GUI layer"
Maurilio is trying and getting to maintain the rhytm

Congratulations to both, they are having good results, as I can see in the
messages

Antonio seem have an "enthusiastic episode" similar to the joy of an
"summer lover". Maybe in an episode like the actual, Harbour was born ...

I thinked about an "Harbour GUI", and I conclude that this may an "Must" in
Harbour, for this reason:
Allmost all the actual programs are GUI based, and the text based are few.
If Harbour is released only for text mode, could not be competitive against
GUI mode programs, even if Harbour is better. If Harbour can be GUI based,
then can compete immediatly even if his GUI model is basic. At end, will
have "GUI look and feeling" as the final user want and are now used

Maybe this step is the "Harbour second air" that will guaranted an long
life and use to Harbour, which reach allmost to 2023 year, as now we know
by an reliable voyager who came from the future

The goal is give to Harbour "weight reasons" to be used by programmers in
an competitive way

If everyone support this and colaborate, Harbour can have in an short time
an "GUI layer"
Antonio and Maurilio proved that

Alexander,

Based on the Win32 experience you may have
acquired building HWGUI, I guess you could
easily adapt the GUI classes Maurilio and I 
are building to run under Win32.

Those classes are really simple, and you may
convert them in a very little time :-)

What do you think about it ?

regards,

Antonio

I think this would be a great Idea.

Do we still have to vote for Dave proposal on the directory structure
for the GUI Framework?
It looked very ok to me! ;-)

It also seems that we could agree on a HB* prefix for class naming.
So HBForm, HBMenu, etc..

If we all can agree on both points we can proceed at full speed! ;-))

As far as I know GTK 1.2  there is no such a function ready

Then we may need to build it ourselves.
I believe it may be quite easy (based
on the Hello source code sample we already
reviewed).

My intention is that Harbour GUI for Linux GTK,
Win32 and OS2 PM, may evolve at the same speed,
to asure that we keep its cross platform capability.

Thanks for the info,


Antonio

That would be excellent.

If you could take some minutes to review
the GUI classes early prototypes we are building 
for a Harbour cross platform GUI, then maybe you 
could use them as a model to connect to KDE2.

We appreciate if you keep us informed about
your progress,

Attached is a *cut and paste* a very simple example of such a function
from my Harbour for Gtk bindings which I wrote almost a year ago.

Subject: [Harbour] Mpostolc() function
Message-ID: <ANEEJCPNEPCPMGBDJOOEAECGCHAA.ignacio@ozs.com>

I am working right now on the Mpostolc function, which returns the row and
column of a given string offset based on the typical Clipper Memo functions.

The problem that I have is that the original Clipper function returns some
values that at least for me are completely wrong. Suppose the following
string:

//           1              2
//  1234567890123456789     0 1
   "This is just a test" + CRLF

Clipper function: (Remember column is zero based)

Mpostolc(cStr,,01) --> {1,0}  // correct line 1, column 0
Mpostolc(cStr,,19) --> {1,18} // correct line 1, column 18
Mpostolc(cStr,,20) --> {1,19} // incorrect since is the CR offset it should
be 18 ?
Mpostolc(cStr,,21) --> {1,21} // completely incorrect since even the maximum
value is 20

As you can see it works correct until it starts the CRLF pair, it treats the
CR as any other char, and when it reaches the LF it even adds one to the
column value. (remember columns are zero based).

Normally this problem has not affect any one since these two functions are
used for search and replace routines inside MemoEdit(), but I believe it
makes no sense to have strict compatibility with Clipper.

I like better to return the maximum column value (in our sample 18) when is
given the offset of the CR (20), and return the pair {2,0} (line 2, column
0) when the offset given is the LF char.

What do you think ?

BTW Mlctopos() is finished, I wil cvs the two functions when we solve this
problem. :-))

 hbsetup.h has this turned on by default:

 For a final release, it makes sense to turn it off as it creates
 about a 30% increase in speed overall.

 It seems the only way to do this is to change the file (comment out
 that line) and rebuild harbour.

 This means the next time I post to cvs it appears as a changed file.

 Am I missing something?  Is there a mechanism to un-set this via
 environment variables or external headers?  If not, shouldn't there
 be?

   DEFAULT ::nHandle TO WinCreateMenu( ::oParent:nHandle )

   WinAddMenuItem( ::oParent:nHandle, oMenuItem:cCaption, Len( ::aItems ),;

Kylix, or, more correctly, CLX, uses QT. However, it's my understanding that
it is (or will) be possible to have CLX target GTK too. Doubtless a Google
search for "kylix kde gtk" or something like that will tell you everything
you need to know.

BTW, what do you mean when you say GLIB? I'm not aware of a widget set by
that name.

 I've reviewed this stuff today and converted os2pm.c to Win32.
 Also I was needed to do some changes in tform.prg - some places there
 are specific for OS/2.
 But I think, that it would be better, if all OS specific stuff will
 be on C level ( os2pm.c, etc. ). Harbour level code ( tform.prg, etc.
 ) should be platform independent.

My mistake. I thought there was one named that way.

BTW, did you had a chance to test the proposed
Linux GTK entry point ?

I guess we may need to implement Dave's proposed directories
structure, even if we keep them on the contrib directory by now.

I don't think we may be able to use the same tform.prg source
code for all the GUIs. That is why, Dave's proposal looks ok to me.

Those different tform.prg must offer some set of
basic datas and methods, but obviously some of them may offer
some extra features that are not supported on other GUIs.

i.e. Windows has the MDI feature, where OS/2 PM (as far as I
know it) don't provide such feature. Probably the same happens
for GTK. 

The idea is that at least a set of features that are available
on all GUIs are common on all different tform.prg. So we may
advise the Harbour programmer, what GUI features are portable
and which ones aren't.

Antonio

 This doesn't work, too, at least, with my converted to Win32 files.
 To make it properly work, we need to do something like:

METHOD Add( oMenuItem ) CLASS TMenuItem
   DEFAULT ::aItems  TO {}
   DEFAULT ::nHandle TO WinCreateSubMenu( ::oParent:nHandle, ::nId )

   WinAddMenuItem( ::nHandle, oMenuItem:cCaption, Len( ::aItems ),;
                   Nil, oMenuItem:nId, oMenuItem:lEnabled )
   AAdd( ::aItems, oMenuItem )
return nil

, where WinCreateSubMenu() creates new menu with CreateMenu() at
assignes it to the oMenuItem. Don't know, how it can be done under
OS/2, but under Win32 the following code works Ok:

HB_FUNC( WINCREATESUBMENU )
{

   MENUITEMINFO mii;
   HMENU hSubMenu = CreateMenu();

   mii.cbSize = sizeof( MENUITEMINFO );
   mii.fMask = MIIM_SUBMENU;
   mii.hSubMenu = hSubMenu;

   SetMenuItemInfo( ( HMENU ) hb_parnl( 1 ),
     hb_parni( 2 ), 0, &mii );
   hb_retnl( (LONG) hSubMenu );
}

As I think I've said earlier, it's highly unlikely that I'll have the time
to take ownership of the GNU/Linux/GTK side of things any time soon. That's
better left to someone who actually wants it and who has the time to spend
on it.

  I'm afraid that we will have problems with synchronizing these

I guess we could now move contrib/os2pm directory

Antonio, I don't have time right now and I have still to start looking at
the menu problem :-(

It seems to me that we are lacking correct MIS_SUBMENU style on top level
menus and to add to toplevel menus the handle of the drop down one (just
a guess).

Your last change puts every item on the menu bar.

Maurilio,

    Could you please either CVS the test program that you are using or
email me a copy of it, so that I can test the new PM mode code with the
IBM C++ complier?

    So far, I found one change that is needed one line 83 in os2pm.c:
The intermediate variable assignment for the window handle is not
needed, because it's a local variable that never gets used again and the
assignment confuses the IBM C++ compiler.

Pay attention, folks.

I just deleted 35 instances of the Sircam virus coming into this list.

The only reason they bounced is because of our 100k byte limit.

I propose we lower that to 50k for a while.

No, I haven't. If I get a spare moment I will. Although, be aware, I don't
really know much about hbmake so all I've ever tested is that it compiles
and that the full screen editor runs up.

Is it possible/wouldn't it make more sense to filter on the SirCam text
and/or filter on the SirCam attachment extensions (of which there seems to
be a very common set)?

Not that 50k is too small.

Asunto: Mpostolc() function


I am working right now on the Mpostolc function, which returns the row and
column of a given string offset based on the typical Clipper Memo functions.

The problem that I have is that the original Clipper function returns some
values that at least for me are completely wrong. Suppose the following
string:

//           1              2
//  1234567890123456789     0 1
   "This is just a test" + CRLF

Clipper function: (Remember column is zero based)

Mpostolc(cStr,,01) --> {1,0}  // correct line 1, column 0
Mpostolc(cStr,,19) --> {1,18} // correct line 1, column 18
Mpostolc(cStr,,20) --> {1,19} // incorrect since is the CR offset it should
be 18 ?
Mpostolc(cStr,,21) --> {1,21} // completely incorrect since even the maximum
value is 20

As you can see it works correct until it starts the CRLF pair, it treats the
CR as any other char, and when it reaches the LF it even adds one to the
column value. (remember columns are zero based).

Normally this problem has not affect any one since these two functions are
used for search and replace routines inside MemoEdit(), but I believe it
makes no sense to have strict compatibility with Clipper.

I like better to return the maximum column value (in our sample 18) when is
given the offset of the CR (20), and return the pair {2,0} (line 2, column
0) when the offset given is the LF char.

What do you think ?

BTW Mlctopos() is finished, I wil cvs the two functions when we solve this
problem. :-))

You might want to give it a couple more days seeing as how you raised the
issue on a Sunday (when some people aren't at work and might not be near
their email). Also, here in the UK for example, Monday was a "bank holiday"
so many people weren't back at their desks until this morning.

It's not necessarily true that "an interface can be "injected" into
*any* class".

But suppose it is; why would that be a problem?

Why not?

I see OO (OOA, OOD, OOP) as a useful (small) step forward to better
software.  Interfaces look to be another (small) step.

John.

Hmm. Sorry, John - I didn't mean to dis interfaces at all. I use them in 
my own code sometimes. It's just that Dave and I were arguing in favour of 
a strong class heirarchy, and interfaces (like a lot of language features) 
enable sloppy programmers to "patch up" their code after the fact.

That said, I'm *very* strongly in favour of interfaces over something like 
multiple inheritance.

Cheers,
Mabster

Plesk, the software that runs the server, comes with a precompiled copy 
of qmail that does not have the patch compiled in for me to break into 
the stream.

I'm lobbying them for it, but for now, I can't break into the stream.

Most useful programming tools and models allow "sloppy programmers" to do
"sloppy things". I don't think that's something we need to worry about here.
All we need to worry about is not being sloppy when building useful tools,
not what sloppy people would do with useful tools.

Now there *is* a fun debate that doesn't belong here. ;>

Ahh, for some reason I thought mailman was doing this job for you.

One other thing I forgot to mention. Unless I'm mistaken your 100k byte
limit is more than enough to capture all SirCam emails anyway. It is my
understanding that the SirCam payload that is added to the head of the
attachment is always in excess of 100k bytes (137217 bytes to be exact).

It seems unlikely that dropping the limit to 50k will capture any more
SirCam emails.

For what it's worth, here's what I use to strip the payload from SirCam
attachments so you can have a look at what people have being unwittingly
emailing to you:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

if [ "$1" ]
then
    if [ -f "$1" ]
    then
        FILENAME=${2:-$(basename "$1" | sed -e 's/\....$//')}
        tail +137217c "$1" > "$FILENAME"
        echo "Extracted $FILENAME from $1"
    else
        echo "Can't open $1 for reading"

Here there is a picture,

as ti stands now we need to different methods, one to add submenus, and one
to add menuitems, Antonio, do you need something different?

As far as I understand it, ::nHandle should
not be initialized (it may remain nil) unless
that menu item has sub menu items.

We are following the VCL rules:

You may add a menuitem to a menu:

   oMenu:Add( oMenuItem )

and you may add a menuitem to a menuitem:
(a drop down item)

   oMenuItem:Add( oMenuItem )

Now we need to develop the Harbour Linux GTK
GUI to match the level we already have on Win32
and OS2 PM.

I have asked a friend (a Linux user) to do some
tests, to check if the proposed Linux GTK entry
point works ok.

If some of you could also test it, that would be
great.

many thanks,

Antonio

Linux GTK application entry point proposal

harbour/source/vcl/mainlgtk.c  

#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include "hbapi.h"
#include "hbvm.h"

int main( int argc, char * argv[] )
{
   gtk_init( &argc, &argv );

   hb_cmdargInit( argc, argv );
   hb_vmInit( TRUE );
   hb_vmQuit();   

   gtk_exit( 0 );

   return 0;
}

Antonio, I will cvs code in minutes,

but, on OS/2 a menu item has hWndSubmenu <> null if that item has a drop down
associated with it. In this case hWndSubmenu contains the handle of the
window of class WC_MENU wich contains that menu item.

The code as it stands works for a two level menu system since TMenu fills
hWndSubmenu and TMenuItem does not or else every menu item will have a
"greater than" sign to give you a hint that there is a drop down associated
with it.

When we add a drop down to a menu item we need to get back from OS/2 the
handle of that menu item and update its MENUINFO structure with the needed
infos.

regards.

A work-around is to re-order the code. :-(

Hi John,

This is due to Ron's error tracking implementation within 
HBCLASS.CH. I think there is no way to change that while keeping 
the ability to check for badly declared Classes. You code is 
working if you add this #define _before_ including HBCLASS.CH.

#define HB_CLS_NO_OO_ERR

PS: This is why your code worked for me :-((( I added it within my 
own topclass.ch... and forgot I added it !

Hope it help.

I think a little bit better entry point would be as follow :

------------- cut --------------------
#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include "hbapi.h"
#include "hbvm.h"

int main( int argc, char * argv[] )
{
   HB_TRACE(HB_TR_DEBUG, ("main(%d, %p)", argc, argv));

   gtk_set_locale();
   if( gtk_init_check( &argc, &argv ) )
   {
      hb_cmdargInit( argc, argv );
      hb_vmInit( TRUE );
      hb_vmQuit();
      /* uncoment the next line if hb_vmQuit() returns */
      /* return 0; */
    }
    else
       fprintf( stderr, "%s\n", "Could not initialize GTK++ subsystem" );

    return( 1 );
}
------------- cut --------------------

but I really dubt we need it at all on X like platforms, instead of a simple
wraper around an initialization code, which is called at a begining of a PRG.
The reason is that, I think a special entry point idea will cause a need of at
least two versions of a libvm - one for a pure console applications and one
for a GUI based aplications on X like platforms, until you explicitly put a
proper mainstd.o or main<gui>.o object file into your link command.

I add cWhere DATA in TMySqlRow for more extend		
Error Handler add!

	Now we can use like following
	oRow:name     := "OJun"
            oRow:address := "seoul"

Harbour Power!

todo : Don't update auto- increment field

Please update it to CVS

And 
Could you let me know how to get CVS ID for update?

I think he's asking if it's a little slow to manage named column access, via
message sends, using the error handler for every access/assign of a column.
It's not uncommon to do this sort of thing using a metaclass that generates
messages when you instantiate it (or perhaps when you connect it to a query
or table) but you seem to have taken a different approach here.

Charles,

no, you have an error every time you change a field,

oRow:Field1 := "a"
oRow:Field2 := "b"
cValue1 := oRow:Field3
cValue2 := oRow:Field4

these are four exceptions which get caught by the error handler and routed
to a ::FieldPut()/FieldGet() call.

Now think about a TBrowse which repaints cells :-)

regards.

I'll surely do, but, there is a way to tell the cvs server to move a file
or do have I to delete them from contrib/os2pm and add them back to
hgf/os2pm?

My opinion is that only the classes and

We are working to offer the highest

In CVS, you have to

1) move the files locally to the new location
2) make a "cvs del <file1> <file2>..." in the old location (note that this
works only if the files are not in the old location any more)
3) make a "cvs add <file1> <file2>..." in the new location.

IIRC the cvs manual, that is the only way to move files.

Maurilio, Alexander,

Another property a la 'Delphi':

CLASS TForm

   ...

   METHOD   nWidth() INLINE WinGetWidth( ::hWnd )

   METHOD   _nWidth( nNewWidth ) INLINE ;
               WinSetWidth( ::hWnd, nNewWidth )


HB_FUNC( WINGETWIDTH ) 
{
   HWND hWnd = ( HWND ) hb_parnl( 1 );
   RECTL rcWnd;

   WinQueryWindowRect( hWnd, &rcWnd );

   hb_retnl( rcWnd.xRight - rcWnd.xLeft );
}

HB_FUNC( WINSETWIDTH )
{
   HWND hWnd = ( HWND ) hb_parnl( 1 );
   RECTL rcWnd;

   WinQueryWindowRect( hWnd, &rcWnd );

   rcWnd.xRight = rcWnd.xLeft + hb_parnl( 2 );

   WinSetWindowPos( hWnd, HWND_TOP, rcWnd.xLeft,
                    rcWnd.yTop, rcWnd.xRight, rcWnd.yBottom,
                    SWP_MOVE | SWP_SIZE | SWP_SHOW );
}

(note: The above C functions must be adapted to Win32 API)

why do you use the underscore trick of naming methods instead of ASSIGN
and ACCESS?

It is not a trick :-) 
It is how Harbour OO engine really works.

Anyhow, feel free to change them into ASSIGN, ACCESS clauses.

Another point is:

Can ACCESS/ASSIGN and INLINE clauses may be used together ?

Arrrrgh, this is one of my "default errors"...don't know how often I typed

you need to call GpiErase(hps) to clear the client window with default color.

Antonio,

here it is with a width of 300 points set with a oForm:nWidth := 300

Please note that under OS/2 WinQueryWindowRect() returns a RECTL
structure which members are absolute to the window size, that is it has
always 0,0 as x,y starting coordinates, while WinQueryWindowPos() returns
a SWP structure which members are relative to the present screen
resolution so WinSetWidth() needs to use a WinQueryWindowPos() call to
correcly change TForm width only.

One other thing we should start to consider is that OS/2 PM origin of
axis is bottom left while win32 is, if I remeber correctly, top left and
I don't know X one.

So we should decide which is TForm origin of axis (I vote for OS/2 one
since it is a cartesian one :-))

regards.

What I've done in the past is download the version of the file I want from
SF's CVS browser, copy it over the file in question and then re-commit. This
has the effect of creating a new revision rather than rolling back but that
might actually be desirable (it seemed to be the time I did it).

While I agree that OS/2 got it more right than most other GUI systems (hey,
I'm an OS/2 fan, of course I'm biased <g>) I think it would be unwise to
adopt an origin that isn't widely used for GUI systems these days.

IIRC the issue of axis origin was one of the things that kept upsetting lots
of people when Xbase/2 was ported to Win32 and become Xbase++.

Antonio,

so we need a set of macros to change origin on the fly for every function
which needs to handle references to screen positions.

I mean macros inside os2pm.c since inside TForm positions would be
"wrong" when used on an OS/2 system.

regards.

Take a look at the following web page for information on extracting an
ol version of a file and replacing the new version with the old version.
http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/admin/cvs/cvsrevert.html

You can also merge out changes, as follows, after which you would
commit the merged version:

It's the method that the CVS documentation recommends using.

Ignacio:

  Thanks!
  
  Everybody:
  We never set a standard: Do we remove items from the todo.txt or
  mark them done somehow?  I recommend removal.

A .tar.gz version of what exactly? The source or a binary build? If they
mean the source then a .tar.gz of that is available (or, it was the last
time I looked at the downloads page).

If they mean a .tar.gz of a binary build of harbour then they'll probably
need to be clear about what platform they are asking about. As it is I don't
think anyone is maintaining a .tar.gz binary distribution for any platform.

I'd second removal. todo.txt should be a record of what we need to do,
ChangeLog* is a record of what's been done. No sense in having a record of
what's been done in two places.

Brian,

I did not do anything with todo.txt, but obviously we should remove  the
entry from that file. Go ahead if you want or I do it myself.

Ignacio:

  Thanks!

  Everybody:
  We never set a standard: Do we remove items from the todo.txt or
  mark them done somehow?  I recommend removal.

Yes, under Win32 and under Linux. And I think anyone interested in, 
including you, can easily test it too at least on Win32. One only needs 
to download a Gtk for Win libraries, set a proper compiler (MingW in 
my case) and prepare a make_gtk.bat(.sh) compiling script.

BTW, seems to me you've ignored a problem with a libvm library, 
I mentioned previously. I think you are complicating things instead
of simplifying them, forcing an existing of a special entry point for 
platforms which do not need it.

ok, many thanks!

We are using the same model we have applied
for OS/2. There is a mainstd.c for console apps,
and a mainpm.c for GUI apps. 

mainlgtk.c should only be linked for Linux GTK
GUI apps.

Marek, if you review contrib/hgf/..., do you think
you could adapt those little classes to work with
GTK ? 

Antonio

It's only mainstd.c for Windows console apps. OS/2 console apps use the
same main.c that all other non-Windows apps use.

David,

(from main.c)

/* NOTE: This is only a container source file, don't put real program
         code here. */

#if   defined(HARBOUR_MAIN_STD)
   #include "mainstd.c"
#elif defined(HARBOUR_MAIN_WIN)
   #include "mainwin.c"
#else
   #include "mainstd.c" /* Use the standard ANSI C entry point if not
speficied

(from main.c)

so it just links mainstd.c for not windows apps.
Am I wrong ?

I wasn't aware of that internal detail in main.c. I was basing my
comments on the Makefile in source/vm that builds mainstd.c and
mainwin.c for Windows and main.c for everything else. Sorry!

This should give you what you want :

__objDerivedFrom( oObject, xSuper )

oObject is the object to test and xSuper can be either an object or 
a className.

I will add soon the method :Isderivedfrom(xSuper) with the same 
functionalities. (In fact I already added it but for an unknow reason, 
I let it remmed within the source (tobject.prg)...

Though we may use it, there is no need for it,
as Windows provides its own GUI, that we may access
directly.

No, please do not put another software wrap, the benefits are so low against
the enormous harms we may have:

- speed
- Dependency
- Inherited bugs
- Incompatibilities on OS new versions or specific Client PC's

Remember that one of the great advantages of Harbour is that is a self
contained EXE and for that reason runs always fine on any PC, please do not
lose that great feature.

Updating the Makefile is trivial so I would do it, but, what I don't
understand (and can't find any docs for) is how all these various "main"
files are supposed to work.

Can anyone explain how it should work? For example, looking at the OS/2
version, there are two main files for OS/2: main.c and mainpm.c. If I'm
reading it correctly this results in two versions of main() being added to
libvm. How does the harbour user then control which main() gets used?

The same problem with occur with GNU/Linux and GTK. How should I, as someone
using harbour on GNU/Linux, say that one program is a terminal oriented
program while another is a GTK oriented program.

Can anyone give a brief explanation (perhaps even sticking said explanation
in the doc directory for future reference)?

All of which might be true, to varying degrees, if someone were suggesting
that GTK *only* be used to implement Win32 GUI support. That, however,
didn't seem to be the suggestion. The suggestion seemed to be that people
shouldn't keep associating GTK with GNU/Linux and only GNU/Linux. Someone
might wish to ensure that GTK support works on Windows too. That seems fine
to me.

Moreover, a GTK using harbour executable would be self-contained in exactly
the same way as a Win32 GUI using harbour exactly is self-contained, or an
ADO using harbour executable is self-contained, or an ADS using harbour
executable is self-contained. A harbour executable, for Windows, that uses
the GUI, which doesn't require external code (even if it is code that is
supplied by the OS) would be quite a feat.

I see no harm at all in allowing someone to develop and maintain
cross-platform GTK support. That won't affect or have any impact on native
Win32 GUI support (for example). Where's the harm in that?

But that's a harbour-build thing isn't it? That will result in a harbour
"distribution" that can either be used to build VIO applications or
Presentation Manager applications but which can't be used to build both
application types.

Dave,

Maurilio may explain you/us how he has organized it
for OS/2. 

For Win32 there is not such problem, as console
and GUI apps, both use the same entry point (mainwin.c).

Antonio,

no, David added this harbour build time configuration which results in a
harbour vm.lib which can be used to build PM programs and in a different one
which ca be used to build VIO programs.

We should find something else for distribution time.

regards.

This is where this dichotomy gets confusing for me. Speaking in the general
case, your average GNU/Linux program also has the same entry point[1], it's
what happens once the program is running that dictates if output goes to a
terminal or graphical windows are created (both can happen, or neither).

On the surface I can see why it makes life easier to have alternate entry
points for the same "environment" (I choose that word carefully but I'm also
aware that it's not the best fit) but I'm also wondering if there's a more
dynamic approach waiting to be discovered.

For example, imagine something like this as the standard main entry point
(note that I've not fully considered what needs to be passed by value and
what needs to be passed by "reference", we probably want to be passing the
address of argc in all of this, not the value of it):

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
    if ( hb_mainInitHook( argc, argv ) )
    {
        hb_cmdargInit( argc, argv );
        hb_vmInit( TRUE );
        hb_mainExitHook();
        hb_vmQuit();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

the key here is hb_mainInitHook() and hb_mainExitHook(). The correct
initHook and exitHook would be supplied at link-time by linking in the
required init module. hb_mainInitHook() and hb_mainExitHook() for your
"normal" application would simply look like:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
int hb_mainInitHook( int argc, char **argv )
{
    HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED( argc );
    HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED( argv );

    return 1;
}

void hb_mainExitHook( void )
{
    /* Does nothing and does it well. */
}
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

whereas the init hook for a GTK+ oriented application would look something
like:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
int hb_mainInitHook( int argc, char **argv )
{
    gtk_set_locale();
    
    return gtk_init_check( &argc, &argv );
}
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

For OS/2 PM it would something along the lines of:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
static HAB hab;
static HMQ hmq;

int hb_mainInitHook( int argc, char **argv )
{
    HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED( argc );
    HB_SYMBOL_UNUSED( argv );

    hab = WinInitialize( 0 );
    hmq = WinCreateMsgQueue( hab, 0 );

    return 1; /* hab && hmq? */
}

void hb_mainExitHook( void )
{
    WinDestroyMsgQueue( hmq );
    WinTerminate( hab );
}
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

and so on and so forth.

Not that I'm actually proposing such a system, but I am wondering if
something like this could be done so that the choice of "entry point" has
nothing to do with having different main*.c files but, instead, is a choice
of using a chosen init/exit module. An approach like this would also allow
harbour users to add their own low-level init/exit hooks.

Thoughts?

I may be missing something, but your
proposal simply moves the problem from
mainxxx.c files to init/exit modules.

But the same linking problem persists.

I guess the solution is on the libraries
the user needs to select to build for his
selected OS target.

The first module will get linked in, unless overridden on the link
command line by includin one of the main object modules, which is what
happens for os2pm for os2/gcc and happens for both vio and os2pm for
os2/icc. In hindsight, I should probably have replaced main with mainstd
for OS/2 in the Makefile, because main has such convoluted includes.

The point of what I wrote was that it moves the init/exit stuff totally out
of the VM and into environment specific libraries, exactly like the GT API
or the proposed HGF hierarchy.

As I understand it (and this comes from my understanding being confirmed by
other posters here), at the moment, the choice of entry point is a harbour
build time decision. That is, you build harbour itself so that it's VM entry
point targets a given environment (in the GNU/Linux case plain old terminal
vs GTK+, lets add QT, LessTif and Tk in the mix for fun too).

Building different VM's for different aspects of the same environment seems
quite painful and inefficient. This is the reason that we've got different
GT libraries.

What I was suggesting is that the entry point "problem" take a similar
approach to the GT API.

> But the same linking problem persists.

What I suggested presents no linking problem at all. At least, no more of a
linking problem than the problem of linking (on GNU/Linux, for example) the
curses or slang GT layer.

> I guess the solution is on the libraries the user needs to select to build

Exactly, that's exactly what I was suggesting. I was, however, wondering if
it could be done in a very granular way, just like the GT layer.

So, if I'm following this correctly, a binary distribution of harbour (of
OS/2 anyway) will ship with the VM as a library, with one of the entry
points linked in, but will also ship with both entry points build as object
files for the user to optionally link in ahead of VM library?

I'm left wondering where the HGF code will live, especially for platforms
where there might be the option of more then one widget set (yes, I know
that's not directly tied to the issue of entry points but it does appear to
be the next obvious question).

That's not true for Harbour for OS/2. Regardless of how you build
Harbour for OS/2, the choice of PM vs. VIO is made when you link your
Harbour program, based upon whether or not your HB_GT_LIB environment
variable is set to os2pm.
