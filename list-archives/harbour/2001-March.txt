Ryszard,

This is getting more interesting...

In Clipper, if the var is created with __QQPUB() __MRelease() will not
release it but MXRelease() will! Same is true for the PUBLIC command.

For PRIVATES neither __MRelease() nor __MXRelease() releases the var,
instead it just becomes NIL.

Both PRIVATE and PUBLICS will get release with __MClear()

In Harbour, __MXRelease() *should* release publics but it does not.

<URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/faq/harbour-2.html#ss2.12> is the
"nutshell" explanation of why we didn't use the LGPL for any part of
harbour.

I don't like these restrictions at all. I don't think there should be any
restriction on what people do with the output from the harbour compiler.
This seems very unfree to me.

This effectively stops anyone building alternative compilers that make use
of the HVM and HRTL, I'm not sure this is what is wanted.

This also seems to have the same restriction against people building
alternative compilers.

For the purposes of clarification (of the situation, not the historical
discussions): not using the LGPL has nothing to do with allowing commercial
software (harbour can be used commercially, all free software can) and
everything to do with recognising that many people will want to distribute
non-free software where their code, the HVM and the RTL will be combined
into one monolithic file.

The LGPL is clear about the licence requirements for a person's code if they
decide to distribute binary versions of LGPL'd code in that way.

See <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/faq/harbour-2.html#ss2.12> for my
explanation of why we didn't go for the LGPL.

Again, to clarify, strike "commercial" from the above and insert "non-free".

I think the harbour exception is ambiguous at best. I'm currently wondering
if we should keep it as it is and perhaps have a short document that
clarifies the *intent* of the exception (or, more importantly, the *intent*
of the copyright holders who use that licence).

The likes of GETSYS and friends should probably still have their licences
relaxed though. I see no point in requiring people who develop non-free
applications with harbour, and who need to fiddle with GETSYS or ERRORSYS,
make an offer to supply the source of those parts of harbour.

Subject: [Harbour] Some observations on the harbour web pages
Message-ID: <20010301094200.K8427@hagbard.davep.org>

Just a small observation about the harbour download page (perhaps this
effects other pages too, I don't know). It speaks a lot about "16 bits" and
"32 bits" and the like. Ideally it should be "16 bit" and "32 bit". That is,
generally, you don't use the plural in this case.

The download page does actually have examples of the singular usage in one
or two of the comment fields.

One other question about the downloads page, is there really any point in
still having the "DevCenter" on there?

On the opening page I noticed:

,----
| MemoEdit() for 95% complete
`----

which doesn't parse very well. Perhaps:

,----
| MemoEdit() is now almost complete
`----

would work better?

On the links page the "Guide to Lex and Yacc" link appears to have moved.
It's no longer at <URL:http://members.nbci.com/thomasn/y_man.htm> but
instead appears to be at <URL:http://epaperpress.com/y_man.html>.

On <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/doc/index.htm> the title:

,----
| Alphabetical list of functions by Categorie
`----

should read:

,----
| Alphabetical list of functions by category
`----

Is <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/doc/overview.htm> anyone's
responsibility? The reason I ask is that it's got interesting statements
like:

,----
| Very important: The preprocessor functionality is not built in yet. So you
| may test only Clipper language without preprocessor commands, etc.
`----

I'd forgotten that there was a time when harbour didn't have a
pre-processor. ;>

I'd be happy to write and maintain an overview if nobody "owns" that
document and if nobody has a burning desire to write it instead. That said,
I think the FAQ probably serves exactly the purpose of that document
(thoughts anyone)?

Also, on <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/doc/index.htm> I'd probably
change the text of the link called "GNU licence" to "The GNU General Public
Licence". There is no "GNU licence", there are many GNU licences (GPL, LGPL,
and GFDL).

On <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/mailinglist.htm> the description for
the harbour talk list talks about the harbour "cominity", that should be
"community". Also, the trailing part that says "fits in Harbour Talk" will
probably read better if it starts with "fit", not "fits".

On <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/crew.htm> it would appear that a
number of country pointers still ain't quite right. For example, Brian Hays'
entry says that he lives in the US but if you follow the link for the US you
get <URL:http://www.worldtime.org/cgi-bin/wt.cgi?cnt=53478&ID=761452251a&land=223>.

<URL:http://www.worldtime.org/cgi-bin/wt.cgi?cnt=53478&ID=761452251a&land=191>
isn't Spain, at least, I don't think it is <g>>

<URL:http://www.worldtime.org/cgi-bin/wt.cgi?cnt=53478&ID=761452251a&land=174>
doesn't look much like Russia.

<URL:http://www.worldtime.org/cgi-bin/wt.cgi?cnt=53478&ID=761452251a&land=168>
makes Poland look a little wet.

That might not be all of them, the above were a random sample.

As you may be aware, a Harbour object is also an array,
this is why it is needed a new function to distinct those

Keeping in mind that you're allowed to do that (if I'm reading it right) but
that the output file has nowhere near the same utility as the input file (in
the context of the intended utility of the input file).

Cool. If I get some time in the next couple of days I'll see if I can come
up with something a little more up-to-date.

Ron,

"clear that the LGPL is far to restrictive for the
defacto understanding of what we want for Harbour."

Don't its "restrictive" issues also cause problems with non-free
software on Linux?  (Pretty much every C app uses the GNU libc.)
I wonder how so many people/companies deal with that, if so.

Your suggested licence looks a good start, but what bothers me is
that creating licences which accurately and unambiguously allow and
prevent the desired things appears to be very hard.  The FSF/RMS have
had several attempts...

BTW, it's one thing to have a license but entirely another to enforce
it.  Costs loadsa money!  Who's providing it?

"1. ... as long as it is being linked with the HVM, and HRTL to form
an Executable. Or being provided in a object/lib form to serve as a
linkable "library" to be linked with Harbour Compiler Generated Output
(either in source or object form), and the HVM and HRTL to form an
executable."

Would that allow a DLL made using harbour.exe?  Is a DLL an
"Executable"?

John.

No, the likes of glibc don't cause problems because glibc is generally used
within the terms of the LGPL. Think about shared libraries (DLLs if you
like) and you'll see why LGPLd code on Unix/Linux doesn't suffer from such a
"restriction".

Enforcement is down to the individual copyright holders. Sure, chances are
that it can't and won't be enforced. The licence speaks to honest people,
not dishonest people.

Yes, DLL is either a linkable library, and or an executable.

Could you please provide an example of what *desired* (from Harbour stand
point) freedom will be restricted by the above. I can't think of any thing
we would *want* to allow, that does not fall within the above.

That's exactly the purpose of the above! Unless I'm mistaken, I 'm not the
only one who does *not* want to see his hard work, used by some other
free/non free software labeled as someone else's compiler. I believe we
would like our work to remain FREE in the context of Harbour, and *only* in
the context of Harbour.

One obvious example is that I may wish to link the harbour output with a HVM
that I've written for myself from scratch, say, a HVM for the Palm or
something. Such a VM might be so different that it couldn't reasonably be
considered to be a HVM. The restriction regarding the output would stop this
from happening.

If that's the case harbour won't be free software after all. Think about it
for a moment, if all free software authors felt that way hardly any of the
tools that are employed in the production of harbour would be available.
DJGPP, for example, could never have existed, neither could Ming32 and the
like.

Where's the freedom in attempting to stop other free software authors from
building on harbour while, at the same time, supporting and allowing the
production of non-free software that makes use of harbour or is built with
harbour?

Why would you want to stop people building free software on top of free
software? Also, why would you want to stop people building non-free software
that makes use of free software?

I find it disturbing that the likes of Clip4Win and FiveW*n would be allowed
to exploit harbour but I wouldn't be allowed to write my own free software
(or even non-free) alternative to the harbour compiler.

I'm not suggesting this. I'm claiming that this is what the Harbour
Exception allows one to do, whereas Dave claims that even reapplying the
change to the original source and rebuilding Harbour qualifies as a
derivative work and forces your application to be under GPL, should you
release a binary-only distribution of it. I can't believe that you
missed the part where I agreed with Dave's suggestion that certain files
that developers frequently modify, such as ERRORSYS.PRG, be released to
the public domain.

One other thought occurs. If what you say here really is representative of
the desires of any harbour copyright holder, let alone all of them, why
would they ever have applied the GPL (with or without exception) to their
code in the first place.

Any copyright holder who has applied the current licence (GPL only in some
places, GPL plus exception in others) to their code can't agree with the
view expressed above because it is incompatible with the GPL.

1. It can't be "so different" if it is designed to run *the* Harbour
Generated Output.

2. Regardless, it will still be considered, HVM because a derivative of the
HVM is allowed as long as it includes the "unmodified portions" of the HVM.

Not true. This will leave Harbour and its use as Harbour as FREE as we
always wanted it. It will not allow a Harbour disguised as something else.

I find the above false and misleading! DJGPP, Ming32, and the like, are
*derivative* of GCC/GLIBC, and are allowed because they are derivative work.
This is also allowed in my suggestion. None of the above pretend to be
anything other then a derivative work. I am confident I wouldn't be allowed
to produce a package including a GCC and GLIBC derivative as RPC, without
having to comply with the GCC and GLIBC GPL and LGPL respectively.

1. There are no limitations on producing, FREE Harbour derivative work
(other then specified in GPL).

2. There are no limitations on producing, FREE or NON FREE Harbour add-ons.

3. There are no limitations on producing, FREE or NON FREE applications,
using Harbour or Harbour Derivative, as a Compiler and RT environment.

Anything outside of that is not freedom, but rather abuse.

Please stop misleading! You are effectively attributing to me invented
intentions! The above is a fiction of your imagination!

You are free to develop a Harbour derivative compiler. You should not be
allowed to "adopt" any portion of Harbour, to be included in a package
disguised as an Harbour alternative, where it is actually Harbour itself*.

*To make this perfectly clear, any one of Harbour 3 core sub systems, the
Complier, the HVM, and the HRTL, is substantial enough entity deserving
protection from being "BORROWED" to serve as a core subsystem of any
"alternative" to Harbour. But can be freely used in the context of a Harbour
derivative (which based on the GPL will have to be a FREE software).

Message-ID: <008c01c0a27a$bc9a1be0$eeb49cc3@detti.hu>

I am very new to this list, but as usual I already have "ideas".  Please
forgive me for that rude behaviour and let me explain shortly:

I am a Clipper developer nowadays working in C++ on U*X systems... and I
miss Clipper and decided to somehow help the Harbour project.  However, I
have veeery limited free time, which I try to spend, hmmm., productively.  I
have subscribed few days ago to this list and started to "monitor" the
messages, as it is asked by the FAQ.  It has stated: this is a Harbour
developer mailing list.  I expected to see - mainly at least - task ideas,
guidelines, questions about development issues etc.  What I have found is
that more is going on here, namely:

- discussion of legal (licensing) issues
- reports (which are usually sent to webmaster@xxx.org) about the web pages
- mails with totally different subject than their content (subject about
LGPL, content about releasing variables)

I don't want to seem to be a stupid (did nothing yet, but already
complaining) guy, but I guess this "chaos" could be made a bit less chaotic.
Let me word the idea(s):

- First of all: if you change the subject, pls do change the _subject_ to
help others to fast find those topics they need/can deal with.  It is
something very little and U can save time for people trying to follow
discussions etc.

- Second: while license issues _are_ very important, I guess this project
has reached a size where those "management-like" issues could (should?) be
discussed on a separate mailing list, since they usually have a light
connection to actual coding, and need a different talent/knowledge - they
have they own area, rights etc.  Of course: anyone interested in those
issues could subscribe to that list.  But I could for example set up more
easily a filter, which takes those issues into a separate mail folder here,
not to mix things.

- Third is the same for the Web pages.  They have their own right, too.
Making them is a separate full task and can easily justify the presence of a
separate list.

- +1: of course, announcements of starting important discussions, seek for
help etc, could be posted on every/any list (could even have its own :-))

Clipper, Harbour... in ship terms: with a small ship U can have the
"commands" and discussions just being "shout" to everyone.  This ship seems
to be big enough now to start separate "threads" for the separate issues.

Practical reason: I guess I am not alone being very busy all the time.
Every/any little automated task and the help with changing the subject can
help me to waste less time on digging and spend more on Harbour.

And again: excuse me by being a newborn here and immediately start something
which may easily feel like criticism.  It is not meant to be.  However
probably being new also means that I had a fresh look onto something which
you have just lived with and got used to.  Remember the frog being cooked
slowly :-)))

Please don't take me wrong and consider my 2 cents as my first contribution
to the Harbour project.  I hope it is and it feels to be constructive.

Finally: Thanx for all the work you have done so far.  You have taken a
great job and a great responsibility and have shown a great deal of
unselfishness as well as dedication.  I honor you all, and I whish that I
will have the opportunity to contribute useful help to this project myself.

All of your sections are at odds with section 2 of the aims for the
Harbour license. Your section 3 omits the requirements of section 4 of
the aims for the Harbour license. All of the sections are too
restrictive.

Please note that not a single Harbour developer objected to these aims
for the license and not one developer provided an alternate list of
aims. These aims were used as the guidelines from which the Harbour
license was developed. And I can't imagine that our aims have changed
since then.

It had been my understanding that the GNU GPL and the Harbour Exception
accomplished those aims. It was certainly my *intent* when I adapted the
Harbour Exception from the Guile Exception that Dave provided.

Hogwash! Read the aims for the Harbour license that are in another

Sorry! I was too quick on the trigger and I take that back. I neglected
to read the entire context of your statement and failed to notice that
it was in reply to Ron's erroneous claim that the Harbour developers
only want Harbour output to be used with Harbour.

Thanks for the input but, I believe you should not report a mistake as a

was followed, just few minutes later, with an apology ("Sorry for the wrong

Thanks for the pointer. I had tried to find the discussion of why we
abandoned going with the LGPL in my mailing list archives, but had no
success.

When I adapted it from the Guile exception, the intent was to fulfill
the aims for the Harbour license that I developed (I quoted them in
another message, so I won't quote them again).

I don't see how making someone include or make available the source to
a modified GETSYS or ERRORSYS is a hardship, but if their developers
wish to relax theor licensing requirements, I won't make any effort to
stop them.

I think we all agree with your aim #2. I believe that having to ultimately
link the compiler output to the HVM and HRTL is not a restriction in the
context of violating aim #2.

2. My sections do not address aim #4 because it is already covered by GPLing
the compiler.

How can you *possibly* claim that requiring that the output from the
compiler be linked with the HRL and HVM is not placing a restriction on
the use of the output from the compiler?

Don't take it on you, I have seen your 2nd mail, too.  There were severeal
such mails, I just realized when the msg was sent that I forgot the"etc."
there.

Please also read my mail again.  I have not mentioned "misuse" anywhere and
I did not report anything either.  Don't take a personall attack where there

It is not clear that my thought (it was never a claim) was erroneous. In any
event, the core of my concern, and proposal is with protecting the HVM and
HRTL. The inclusion of the Compiler Output, just seemed to offer a more
complete view.

I will not "fight" to "protect" the Complier Output. But I most certainly
will do my best to protect the HVM and HRTL.

Here is the core of my concern, if we allow any portion of the HVM, and or
the HRTL to be included in *any* application, without subjecting such to any
Harbour Licensing, we effectively allow any company, say Alaska, to develop
just the Compiler, include our HVM and HRTL (modified or not) in a form of
executable (such as a Linker), and thus being able to provide say xBase++ II
(2/3 Harbour), without having to respect any Harbour Licensing issue.

I think most of us would consider the above scenario un-acceptable. But in
effect we might very well allow it, based on the current ideas.

Ron

Nonsense! Here's the full text of the Harbour Excption:

Which means that your example would run afoul of the GPL, because the
exception applies to linking the HRL and/or HVM for the purpose of
producing an executable and does not apply to linking them for the
purpose of distributing them for use by other programs.

Excellent, this is *exactly* the protection we've always wanted for the
various parts of harbour. However, the text you proposed also would prohibit
the use of code from any part of harbour in other related or unrelated free
software projects.

Note that we have *exactly* this kind of protection right now and have had
it since the moment the GPL was applied to all the files in harbour. The
text you proposed would tighten up this protection where it isn't necessary,
it would do it in a way that makes harbour less than free and it would
penalise free software developers who want to make use of parts of harbour
without adding anything to the current level of protection.

The problem with this is that licensing is an issue for copyright holders
and copyright holders are more or less the same set as developers. Licensing
is also a development issue.

Licensing actually makes for a very small part of the content of this list.
It just so happens to be the focus of the list at the moment because we're
heading for a more beta-oriented phase and we want harbour to be useful to
everyone and we want the licence details to be as unambiguous as possible.

The *only* people who can make that happen are the copyright holders. It's
not possible to have a "licensing team" work on this on their own list.

It was, IIRC, in harbour talk and I've got that going back to the moment I
subscribed. If you like I could probably hunt for it for you (although I
think the entry in the FAQ gives a useful nutshell explanation of the
reasoning I gave).

Well, yes, you're right, it's not a hardship in any physical sense. I'm
thinking more that it's a legal requirement that people could probably do
well without. I know that I'd prefer not to have to worry about it too much.

I could be totally new code, written from scratch. IOW, it wouldn't be a
derived work and wouldn't be related to the HVM (you may recall that in the
early days such a beast existed, it was a Java based version of the HVM).

If you're talking about a derived work you're not talking about a VM written
from scratch.

How is using harbour, as per the terms of the GPL, "disguised"?

Wrong. DJGPP is a port of GCC to DOS which a written, from scratch, CRTL.

Of course you'd have to comply with those the GPL and the LGPL. Likewise,
the GPL allowed DJ Delorie to take GCC and mix it with his own, written from
scratch, CRTL.

Given this, what would be wrong about taking the harbour compiler and mixing
it's use with a written, from scratch, HVM and HRTL?

That's not what you've suggested. You've already said that you don't want
people using the harbour compiler with non-harbour derived VMs and RTLs.
You've also said that you don't want the HVM or RTL used with code that
wasn't produced by the harbour compiler.

Wrong Ron, I'm pointing out to you the loopholes in your suggested licensing
scheme. Why bother asking for feedback if you're simply going to shout it
down when it isn't fully in your favour?

You're telling me I'm wrong yet your reasons come from ignorance. Go and
actually look at the DJGPP situation and you'll see exactly what I'm talking
about.

Am I free to develop a free compiler that borrows no code from the harbour
compiler at all but makes use of the HVM and HRTL? What about a non-free
compiler?

The GPL says otherwise.

Such protection would mean that harbour ceases to be free software and,
quite possibly, open source software (as per the OSD) too. I'm not sure
that's what you really want.

You seem to be suggesting that the smallest or largest part of harbour can't
be taken and used in other free software projects. Is this really what
you're suggesting?

Ron,

"Unless I'm mistaken, I 'm not the only one who does *not* want to see
his hard work, used by some other free/non free software labeled as
someone else's compiler. I believe we would like our work to remain
FREE in the context of Harbour, and *only* in the context of Harbour."

I don't have any interest in doing that, OTOH wouldn't a Clip-4-Win32
using Harbour be doing something (arguably) somewhat similar?  Anyone
could argue that I couldn't sell such a C4W without Harbour's existence
and thus that I was making money out of (because of) Harbour.  Without
getting into whether that would be an accurate description, I'm not
sure I see why it would be OK to sell an add-on but not OK to sell the
compiler, RTL, etc.

I can see it might be questionable behaviour - I just wonder why
people might be so keen to prevent it.  I'm not sure who the people
are who'd be willing to _buy_ such a thing, either!  My guess is that
most wouldn't - unless it also included significant added value, in
which case wouldn't that be a good thing?

However, what _really_ worries me is that at the moment the license
apparently isn't open enough.  Shouldn't we err on the side of being
too open rather than not open enough?

John.

David,

"whereas Dave claims that even reapplying the change to the original
source and rebuilding Harbour qualifies as a derivative work ..."

I believe Dave's correct: any change (no matter how small or why it's
made) creates a derivative work.

"I agreed with Dave's suggestion that certain files that developers
frequently modify, such as ERRORSYS.PRG, be released to the public
domain."

I also agree.

(It doesn't affect me in that I'd be happy to release Clip-4-Win32's
ERRORSYS.PRG to the Harbour project, but the basic idea of various
files being completely PD does look sensible.)

GTCRS is the library you want to be looking at for terminal IO under
GNU/Linux.

If you're running a RedHat based system there's an RPM of 0.36 available for
download on the harbour web site. If you don't like binary builds but do
have an RPM based system you can grab the SPRM and build it yourself, it'll
do the "right thing" in regards to including the right libraries.

Just to clarify what I say here, there should be no reason for stopping a
company like the above from doing what you say, the important point being
that they *must* respect the harbour licence. If they wrote their own
compiler that targeted the HVM and HRTL that should be fine as long as they
distribute the HVM and HRTL within the terms of the GPL and the harbour
exception.

The less desirable situation would be if they modified the HVM or HRTL and
distributed that without making the source available. Seeing as how the
licence of that code is the GPL with an exception and seeing as how they
would have "invalidated" the exception they'd *have* the make the source
available or they would be breaking the terms of the licence.

If it really is the desire of all the harbour copyright holders that such a
freedom not exist then a whole new licence needs to be designed because I
don't see how you can usefully stop such use of the code while using the GPL
as the basis of the harbour licence. At least, not without trying to write
an exception that makes harbour less free (as opposed to the current
exception which seeks to make it more free).

Any copyright owner who never wanted to allow such a use of harbour's code
should never have applied the GPL plus exception to their code in the first
place.

Sadly this is far from nonsense! Please re-read my scenario.

1. Based on the current exception I *can* certainly *link* compiled HVM and
HRTL into my *executable*(1). My resulting *exe*(1) is *not* covered by the
Harbour License.

2. This executable(1) can easily be a linker application.

3. This linker, in-turn *can* link the HVM and HRTL segments of self, along
with Harbour compatible compiled code, thus producing the User Application
executable(2).

4. In this scheme both the HVM and HRTL have been linked into executables
not once, but twice, and both times such linking is covered and "excused" by
the current exception.

The above means my fictitious scenario above is 100% valid, and would *not*
be in violation of our license, because it falls neatly under the current
exception.

There is nothing that subject executable(1), or executable(2), to any
Harbour License, because there only relationship to Harbour is the "mere"
link inclusion of the HVM and HRTL which is *completely* excused.

Hope this does clarify the problem.

Ron

Current exception *allows* the above scenario, and offers absolutely *no*

Please explain, how would GPL protect us against my pretend scenario, when

It would not be under GPL, or I would have had no concern. It is excused

Now you also "know" the scope of my logic? Try this, I asked you to stop
miss-stating my intentions, because you did exactly that. I do *not* want to
"stop non free software that makes [valid] use of free software". It is our
reasonability to provide clear license so that every one can tell, what

Apparently, ignorance is not discriminating, and when combined with

1. It wouldn't be similar! To "qualify", you would have to pretend you
developed a full fledge compiler, when in actuality, you only developed a
small portion, and then "borrowed" the rest from Harbour, without having to
give it any credit.

2. I never attempted to stop anyone from making money off of Harbour. This
is 100% legitimate when *not* in violation of a license which the copyright
holders agree with.

But the Harbour Exception *does* allow them to link the HVM and HRTL into
*any* executable, *without* submitting such executable to the Harbour
License. So *no*, as it stands now, they do *not* have to respect
*anything*, other than our naive generosity.

To Phil. Dave, David, Ron and all.

Just imagine what can I do in agree with the Harbour License terms:

1. I made some modification to errorsys.prg (like logging option) and
getsys.prg (calculator-like number input). This code is GPL-ed, so I will
send it to the Harbour developers to add it to the project.
2. Then I will wait for your decision what to do with my code. You can put
it into the Harbour core or maybe into some contribs.
3. In the same time I can make my own distribution of Harbour, OK?
And my Alias Harbour distribution will include my code and the rest of the
Harbour both with the Harbour License terms.
4. Now I have a new HVM/HRTL ready to use with my commercial applications.

So it is just much longer way to have what I want, but I can do it. Or am I
missing/misunderstanding something?

I am not sure this is _the_ answer, but it certainly would not hurt.

My question is: How will we identify which parts of the VM and RTL 
some programmer will want to modify and include in the next n 
years?

So, if some group wanted to fork the code base and create Harbour

Yes, you can do this, but I think this is exactly why we are trying 
to tie down the exception and where it stops, making this a 
frivolous exercise.

Forking the code for such a trivial thing is silly and nobody here 
wants that to happen.

We will find another way.

I'm not sure I understand the question. It is my understanding that any and
all derivative kind of work is allowed in the GPL. The Exception we discuss
is not designed to limit any aspect of the GPL, but rather loosen it. !!!
Light Bulb !!!

****************************************************************************
* Dave, please re-read my proposal, it does *not* take away any of the GPL *
* rights, it simply *allows* you to dismiss any of the GPL liabilities by  *
* meeting the specified conditions. But these are the conditions for the   *
* *exception*, which means if these conditions are not met, what ever you  *
* do with Harbour falls back to the GPL arena, with all its rights and     *
* liabilities!!!                                                           *
****************************************************************************

My concern is with the Harbour Exception:

1. The current Exception does not explicitly cover modified versions of the
HVM/HRTL. This means that even the smallest of changes, like ErrorSys or
GetSys, effectively renders the exception void. This is way to strict.

2. OTOH, the Exception, allows any 3rd party, to provide any executable form
of the HVM and HRTL, without enforcing any bit of the Harbour License. This
opens the door, to possible "abuse". Yet it would not be abuse because we
"allowed" it. (Read my pretend Alaska scenario for an example). This is way
too liberal.

3. How do we address #1. above without making #2. even worse? By allowing
such 3rd. party to modify any portion of the HVM or HRTL, and still be
covered by the current exception would have almost the same effect as
donating the HVM and HRTL to public domain (because in executable form, they
are 100% free (excluded) of any license.

I therefore believe that in order to allow complete freedom, to modify the
HVM and HRTL, and further allow the HVM and HRTL to be *excluded* from the
GPL when linked into executable, we must introduce some additional condition
before the Exception take effect. My idea was that this additional
condition, will require that this excluded executable is indeed an Harbour
application (which is what we intended the exception for, but never exactly
defined).

Dave, David,

It just occurred to me when responding to Phil, that you have been reading
my proposed Exception Condition as if they no longer allowed the rights
granted by the GPL license.

The moment we GPLed Harbour it is *guaranteed* to offer *at* *minimum*, all
of the rights granted by the GPL to any and all Harbour users.

Our exception (current or proposed) is only describing when will the user's
rights *escalate* to allow anything and everything he/she wishes to do with
the software.

By describing when the GPL will *not* take effect, the user learns when
he/she are given *infinite* rights beyond the GPL, without having any
License liability.

So as long as you don't claim that the GPL is intending to "stop people
building free software on top of free software" or, intending to "stop
people building non-free software that makes use of free software", my
proposal can not be described as such either, because it only add rights
without removing any!!!

Ron

The quick and obvious answer is those parts which people used to be able to
modify as part of CA-Clipper.

All other parts of harbour can be modified also but you only get to use
those modifications if you yourself and seeking to build free software with
those modifications. I guess this "cost" is the cost of seeking to use free
software to build non-free software.

Noted. So, what I should really do is update the README for harbour and then
the changes will "ripple" thru the documentation system and find their way
into the web pages (and into the help files too)?

Right now, as the licence details stand, if you decided to make your own
distribution of harbour and in doing so modify part of the RTL, GETSYS.PRG,
in your example, GETSYS.PRG falls squarely under the GPL, no exception,
which means that your distribution of harbour as a whole falls under the
GPL, which means that anyone using that distribution can't enjoy the
exception and any application they build must comply with the GPL and the
GPL only.

The exception, as it stands, does open harbour up to possible abuse, of this
there is no doubt (I think we've discussed this possibility before). The
moment you seek to add an exception to the GPL (and probably most free
software licences) it does become horribly complicated. This is an
unfortunate side effect of having an exception that absolves people of their
duties to free software when they are building non-free software.

I'm not certain there is a useful way of stopping this with the licence
details becoming horribly complicated and without it compromising
free-software use of any and all parts of harbour.

This is what I've been trying to get over to you about the text you
proposed. Said text is an exception to make harbour less free, unlike the
current exception which seeks to make it more free. While your proposed
exception would most probably stop BigEvilCorp from playing out your
scenario it also stops NiceFreeSoftwareGroup from making use of parts of
harbour too.

Personally, I'd sooner allow your scenario than stop NiceFreeSoftwareGroup
from doing wonderful things for the world of free software using parts taken
from harbour. Besides, in the above scenario I'd apply Hanlon's Razor,
chances are such an application would be correct and they'd "do the right
thing" once politely asked. If not they'd probably not actually play nice no
matter the licence details of harbour, probably working on the assumption
that they've got more money to fight a legal battle than any one of us have.

The GPL can't and doesn't say what is a derivative work. Copyright law
dictates that. The text above says so. If I sit down and write a work-a-like
from scratch it isn't a derivative work.

If what you claim *is* true that means that harbour is a derivative work of
CA-Clipper and that you should all be thinking of handing copyright over to
CA and that harbour should be using CA's licence.

Are you going to keep trying to find ways of ignoring the point I'm raising
or are you going to acknowledge that it is entirely possible for totally
independent VM and RTL implementations to exist?

Unless it isn't a derivative work.

I've read the GPL once or twice Ron, I first read it in the early 90s and
have read it many times since. I've also GPLd many items of code that I've
released as free software and have actually signed over to the FSF so I
think I know what's in there. I won't claim to have a perfect knowledge of
the GPL but I know it well enough that having total knowledge of it would
tell me nothing about how DJGPP's RTL isn't a derived work of GLIBC.

However, have you actually read about DJGPP's CRTL? You said:

,----
| DJGPP, Ming32, and the like, are *derivative* of GCC/GLIBC, and are allowed
| because they are derivative work.
`----

which is partly wrong (totally wrong when you look at what I was saying in
total). As I point out above (and you seem not to notice) the CRTL of DJGPP
has nothing to do with GLIBC in terms of actual code, it isn't a derived
work of GLIBC and it isn't under the GPL in normal circumstances (I seem to
recall that making a derived work if it places it under the GPL but that's a
totally unrelated matter, that's simply it doing more or less what we're
doing with the VM nd RTL).

Have you read about the DJGPP RTL Ron? Can you see why I mentioned it as an
example of mixing a derived work compiler with a totally fresh
implementation of a RTL that isn't a derived work and isn't ordinarily under
the GPL?

Why do you think the GPL speaks about this situation when it isn't the GPL
you should be looking at to understand how DJGPP came to be?

Get a clue Ron. I never misstated your intentions, I provided the feedback
you desired. Either you can't see why what I say is the case, in which case
you're after clarification, feel free to ask for it, or you don't want to
see what I'm saying in which case you're simply being argumentative.

What is your problem Ron Pinkas? Why do you always try and bully people who
provide the feedback you request but which doesn't provide totally positive
feedback? If you stop your bullying and arrogance for just one moment and
actually go and check on the examples I've given you'll see what I'm saying
and why the text you posted *does* prohibit the development of free software
based around the code in harbour.

Do you understand that, even though it wasn't your *intention* that the text
you propose stops the development of free software, the *implementation* of
those directions would? Do you understand that I've said everything I've
said because I care about free software and that I care about *your* free
software and that none of what I've said has been said out of ignorance or
arrogance?

Accept the feedback I've given you with the same spirit in which it was
given and you'll find that there's an important point in it.

Or, alternatively, you can try and represent my feedback as ignorant
arrogance and be none the wiser despite asking for it. It's your choice Ron.

Yes, the GPL is used to provide anyone with a licence to make a derivative
work as long as that work retains the same licence.

Well, not quite that way, I was speaking about and in response to the
absolute terms it used. It didn't seem to suggest anywhere that it was
talking about non-free use and only non-free use. It was ambiguous enough to
introduce the confusion I was highlighting.

Hmm, I'm not sure this is the right way to express the purpose of the
exception. The exception is only there to allow people to distribute binary
renderings of GPLd code in a non-free way. That might not seem like a
significant difference from what you say above but it is quite important.

Again, you need to be very cautious with your wording here. The exception
doesn't absolve the user from observing the GPL in it's entirety, only in
how they can licence their own work when making use of harbour and what they
need to do in terms of distributing binary renderings of harbour code when
it is part of their application.

Ron,

"2. This executable(1) can easily be a linker application."

Sounds unlikely, OTOH maybe people would like more choice of linkers.

"The above means my fictitious scenario above is 100% valid, and would *n=

Fictitious, OK, but what would be the harm?  Someone would've written
a linker - no small task.  They'd be benefitting from Harbour.  Why's
it different to me with a Clip-4-Win32 using Harbour?  Why do we care?
Er... do we?  I don't think I do (but it's not my decision).

Hmm... I just read some of the other messages about code already under
GPL.  In that case isn't the above (fictious or otherwise) scenario
already allowed and indeed something there's no point in debating
because we cannot prevent it (GPL can't be revoked IIRC)?

Or would the situation be that the linker author would have to GPL
his code as well?  I can imagine they might well not be willing to do
that.

This is why a lot of people donate thir copyright to the FSF.

One alternative would be to form a non-profit corporation to 
administer and hold the copyright(s), with the board of directors 
being formed from Harbour Developers and contributors, as defined 
by the corporations bylaws.

I've built such a corporation in the last two years in our Linux User 
Group, and it's been a LOT of work.

That's not to say that I wouldn't do it, as I already know many 
paths to go down to make it easier, but we'd all have to make that 
kind of decision collectively, and we'd all have to chip in some 
cash. That's one thing I've found. Any corporation, even a non-profit, 
has expenses. For our LUG, we've found that 16 members paying 
$35 a year is enough to keep it afloat. (just opening a bank 
account, which is mandatory, costs $15 a month, and there are 
yearly filing fees with the state of $87.50. Filing for federal 501(c)3 
status costs as much as $500 and I don't know if there is a yearly 
fee after that, but I suspect there is.)

This way, the copyrights could be held by a legal entity instead of 
by individuals, thus giving us an instrument to carry on past 
individual lifetimes or periods of participation.

Also, finding a benefactor to set up a trust to pay for it all would be 
another goal.

But, the FSF has already done all of this...

For this to work wouldn't we need a "harbour foundation", some form of
non-profit organisation to actually hold the copyright? I'm not sure that
copyright can be assigned to an entity like "a bunch of people who might
change over time". Doesn't it need to be something more concrete?

Then, if we did want a non-profit organisation we'd have to decide *where*
it was created, who ran it, how it was funded, how, who, where, why...

<shudder>

I'd advise talking to the FSF about them taking on the copyright before
anyone think about having some harbour oriented entity allow copyrights to
be signed over.

I think "we" do care and should care. Ron is highlighting the fact that the
current exception leaves the harbour code open to the kind of "abuse"[1]
that the GPL attempts to stop. That is, it's not desired that someone can
make minor changes to parts of harbour and release a new compiler based
around harbour without releasing it as free software.

The harbour exception allows (and is designed to allow) someone to build
non-free software that includes free software. Ron is talking about a
possible loophole that would allow someone to get around the wishes of
many/all of the harbour copyright holders.

Ron's example is highly contrived, granted, but that's actually the point.

If we didn't have the exception then such a situation could not happen
without breaking the terms of the licence. The harbour exception allows
people to "break" the licence (the GPL) for the purposes of building their
own non-free applications[2]. Ron is pointing out that any sufficiently
deceitful MegaEvilNastyPeopleCorpIncPLCGmbH could twist and turn their way
between the GPL and the exception to come up with a non-free harbour when
the whole point and intent of harbour is that it is first and foremost free
software.

-----
[1]  Actually that's putting the cart before the horse. The behaviour in
question is only "abuse" because a licence like the GPL is in place, if the
licence was a "more free" one it wouldn't be "abuse" because such actions
would be permitted. Think BSDL or (not that it's really a "licence") PD.

[2]  Note that I ran all of this by RMS (for those who don't know, the
founder of the FSF and the author of the GPL) and he agreed that, given our
particular set of licensing problems, we had chosen a sensible route to a
solution. Note that it's also the same solution chosen by at least one other
item of free software (guile) which, as it happens, is also part of the GNU
project.

I've not tried a build against slang for ages (hmm, I really should). Couple
of things occur to me, first off, are you using the same version of slang as
he is when your build works fine? Second, does the missing function actually
exist in slang 1.4? I seem to recall that 1.4 has some significant changes
when compared to 1.3.

That depends on what you consider to be a problem. For starters, you need to
sign over your copyright, some people might see that as a problem. Also, if
you have a copyright you want to sign over you've got to be sure that, even
as the sole copyright owner, you've got the permission of every major
contributer to the code you've got copyright on.

On top of that some people might not "trust" the FSF to do the right thing
in the future.

Of course, there's the chance that the FSF might not want to accept the
copyright unless *all* of harbour is signed over. That would be quite a
large undertaking (as would signing over copyright to any entity).

You may recall that, in the early days of harbour, I suggested that people
keep track of who had made major contributions to their copyrighted work, it
was for this very reason what I made that suggestion.

The above compiles correctly with SimpLex build.

But there appears to be a small PP error, I'll try to fix the PP bug, will
check again with Flex and let you know.

U have been right about that.  I sent the mail too fast and

Actually noone does on the Net. :-))  This is my private

work for them.

Seriously.  I am known usually as White Wolf on the net.=20
The FA is an initial for my Hungarian name, which would not
tell U anything anyway.  Stick with WW or wwolf, or wolof or
White Wolf :-)  That is what I use for ages.  No offense

have started programming.

I use FA here since I picked up a different mailbox for
Harbour, to ensure I can clearly filter the Harbour list
into a separate folder.  So since this EMail isn't WW I use
the FA here.

OK, I was long enough.  THX again for the welcome and I hope
I can soon pick up something (easy enough) where I can start
real contribution.

Which would mean that the program is *not* just a linker, but a linker
that is bound to two libraries, with the two bound libraries qualifying
as binary distributions, which are covered by the GPL, but *not* by the
Harbour Exception.

Wrong! See #3.

Wrong! The "relationship" from program #1 to program #2 is a *binary
distribution* of the HVM and HRL (please note that it is *not* proper to
refer to the HRL as the HRTL), which means that while program #1, by
itself, is covered by the Harbour Exception, what it does with the HVM
and HRL is *not* and falls *exclusively* under the GPL.

Yes, we can. Dave has mentioned that the Guile project has a similar
exception and that it *is* a GNU project.

You might have intended such, but this is no more than wishful thinking,
because the Exception *does* say:

"Your use of that executable is in *no* way restricted on
account of *linking* the HRL and/or HVM code into it."

No both executables are in "no way restricted on account of linking the HRL
and/or HVM code into them"!!!

Every time you link the compiled HVM/HRTL it is be definition is a "binary
distribution". The Exception specifically excuse this kind of distribution
from being covered by our License.

Hi,

I'd like to prepare to work on Harbour.  I have BCC32 (free) and a Win98 PII
stuff to work on (and an old desktop).  Is there anyone (not to pollute the
list) who could "assist" me if I hit anything?  Like a list of what else I
need would be good (I have read the FAQ, and will further).  It seems I have
to go deep into a problem which also effects OO - something about not being

The harbour exception is based on the guile exception and I think (I'll have
to double check) that guile is copyright the FSF. Also, RMS has seen and
checked the harbour exception and he was happy with it, he did this by proof
reading section 2 of the harbour FAQ for me:

,----[ <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/faq/harbour-8.html#ss8.4> ]
| Revision 1.11  2000/01/10 16:55:43

| Improved some of the language regarding the GPL (thanks to RMS for his
| input on this subject).
`----

I doubt that the harbour exception would be an impediment to such a course
of action.

I gues, (excuse me for mambling) that even _having_ a license forbiding this
would not prevent people form actually doing it if they want.  I guess all U
can do against it to make Harbour _very_well_ known so people cannot be
cheated this way. :-((

Suppose someone copies a stable version of the Harbour sources, changes few
things to (eg) C++, starts a grep and changes function names etc.  In many
country (law system) you will not be able to proove it is the same code.

All but six HRL and HVM code modules either state that the are public
domain or that they are covered by the Harbour Exception (I did a visual
inspection of all .c, .h, .l, .prg, .slx, and .y modules in all source
directories other than source/compiler, which isn't included in either
the HRL or the HVM, and the include directory).

The siz modules are: macroa.c, macrob.c, macroc.c, and macroslx.c, all
of which are located in the source/macro directory, and dbfcdx1.h and
dbfcdx2.h, both of which are located in the source/rdd/dbfcdx directory.

Hopefully the authors of those modules will update them with the
appropriate notice.

David is actually correct. The executable *is* covered by the harbour
licence otherwise it wouldn't be enjoying the benefits of that exception.

I've said it a number of times before: the licence for harbour speaks to
honest people, not dishonest people. It tells honest people how to stay
honest and it allows honest people to detect dishonest people.

The Harbour Exception is part of the Harbour License! It does *not*
exclude programs from the Harbour License, it excludes *part* of the
*GPL* from your *use* of the excecutable, which is *still* covered by
the Harbour License.

That is like saying that laws against stealing don't prevent people from
doing so.

1. Most people will not do what they know to be illegal.
2. Without such laws we would have no definition for, what is valid as
oppose to what's not.

We never imagined we could stop illegal actions from taking place. We only
seek to define what is/isn't allowed with regard to taking advantage of
Harbour.

If the linker was written with Harbour and only uses the HRL and HVM to
run the linker, then that is fine and dandy and the linker would be
covered by the Harbour Exception.

But, if the linker *also* includes a binding of the HRL and/or HVM for
inclusion in the programs that it links, then the linker would *not* be
covered by the Harbour Exception, because *this* use of the HRL and/or
HVM would fall under the binary distribution clause of the GPL.

So because your example involves the second use, the linker is *not*
covered by the Harbour Exception, but the programs that it creates would
probably be covered.

Basically that is what I have said (meant), too.  And the only way to
prevent dishonest people from exploiting Harbour is to ensure that
everybody, every potential victim, every ClipperHead knows about the Harbour
project and will not be mislead by someones "re-packing" of it.

I guess it's my turn to say "Total and utter nonsense"!

Try convincing a Judge or Jury, that "in no way restricted", does *not*
fully and completely, relinquish any, and all, rights to claim what is/isn't

The very second the Exception takes effect, *all* liabilities described in
the GPL, become null and void, because we gave an irrevocable right to use
such executable free of *any* *restriction*.

Nope.  Saying it says that while laws against stealing a horse _are_

I knew this even before asking the advice of my copyright attorney, but he
made it crystal clear. Once the Exception grants the right to use such
executable without *any* *restriction*, you have effectively granted
irrevocable rights which can *not* be legally restricted by the granting
party!!!

Both are completely and unconditionally covered. I suggest you seek legal
advice to verify this.

Of course, you do all realise that anyone who has been distributing
applications built with harbour that include the macro compiler have been
doing so in breach of the harbour licence.

If you simply want help using harbour then the harbour-users mailing list is
there for that purpose. If you've found a bug in harbour and you want to get
the developers to help you track it down then this is the right mailing list
to use.

Correct, that's because the exception is in force. The licence does apply,
it's the application of the licence that's protecting the application's
non-free code from the GPL.

If the executable wasn't covered by the harbour licence then the exception
wouldn't be in force and the GPL would come to the forefront.

The licence doesn't cease to act after a link is complete and distribution
has taken place, the licence kicks in to it's fullest extent at that point.
Large parts of the GPL speak about the requirements when you *distribute*
binaries, the exception has to be "working" to separate the licence
requirements of the GPLd code in the binary from the non-free code in the
binary.

Think of the harbour exception as a condom, it only works while it's in use.

That's totally false!!! Please check with any copyright attorney before
making such baseless claim.

The Exception grants unconditional, irrevocable, rights to use this
executable, free of any restriction what's so ever! This freedom is never
terminated and the GPL never "kicks in" on the account of *any* usage of
this executable.

But all such parts are NULL and VOID, when it comes to this executable.

Which means forever as far as the lifetime of this executable.

Dave, David, All,

Here is a [simplified] legal description of the impact of the GPL + the
Harbour Exception on *any* excusable, where its only reliance on Harbour is
the link inclusion of the compiled HVM and/or HRTL (the Executable):

1. The second the link takes place, usage of the resulting Executable, is
subject to the GPL.

2. That very brief of an instant described in paragraph 1. above, the GPL is
being modified by the copyrights holder (Licensor), so as to create a new
license (HGPL). You *must* read this License (HGPL), as if a magic wand (the
Harbour Exception), has erased *any* and *all* language, that reads as a
restriction, while leaving intact everything else.

3. Any and all usage of the Excusable is subject to the HGPL and no other
License (unless such Excusable is relaying on other copyrighted material,
subjecting it to License granted by *other* copyright holder) for the
duration of its life time.

In summary, anyone is free to use any such executable, anyway they see feet,
without having to comply with any restriction (because no such restriction
exists), yet being granted each and every right described in the GPL.

All "excusable" should read "Executable". Funny how this speller trick,
still left the text kind of valid.

You are focusing on a small fragment of the Harbour Exception and are
failing to understand how it works in context with the entire Harbour
License. Here is the entire Harbour Exception again:

You are making the erroneous assumption that the sentence "Your use of
that executable is in no way restricted on account of linking the HRL
and/or HVM code into it" means that there are no restrictions whatsoever
on the use of the executable. But what is *actually* says is that
*merely* linking the HRL and/or HVM code into your executable does not
restrict your use of the executable. It does *not* say, or even *imply*,
that there are no other factors that can restrict your use of the
application. And some of the things that can *still* restrict your use
of the executable include, but are *not* limited to: using the
exectuable to performa a binary distribution of any part of Harbour or
the use of any modified Harbour source code.

Apparently not. I ran 'cvs log' on both files. They were both committed

Thanks you. I've finally build it. I would, probably, add -lm -lncurses
options to gcc command in bin/bld.sh that it could find appropriate
libraries (As I had to do). I ran some included tests. Some of them, like
"hello", "box", are OK, while others, like "dirtest", failed. Is this the
problem with gtcrs or with other code?

Curious, you're talking about a claim I never made. I'm sure the claim is
baseless but it isn't a claim I made.

The GPL has not been modified. The "harbour licence" isn't a modified

The GPL doesn't generally speak about the *use* of an executable so I'm not
sure what you mean about usage.

Perhaps you're speaking about distribution?

He's been following Harbour since very early on, but didn't become
actively involved in development until last year. He submitted some
DBFCDX code to the mailing list when we were waiting for Bruno, then in
October we gave him write access to the CVS and he committed a bunch of
DBFCDX stuff. Since October, he's only posted to the list once (February
20).

If we haven't heard from him by Wednesday (or so), I'll send him a
private email.

RE CDX:
Don't forget Ryszard is in the middle of extensive work on that; the
existing files may be superfluous depending on what he's done.

Which does raise another question:  If one developer starts a small prg and
puts the standard header on it with his/her copyright, but then another
developer writes 10 yards of code to flesh it out, who gets any copyright?
Especially where the startup has stubs for functions and the second
developer writes all the guts, it can't be designated as "These functions
copyright XYZ".  And what if the first developer's code gets bug-fixed to
where there's nothing left of the original besides function names?  Does a
subsequent developer have the right to simply remove the first developer's
code altogether and replace it with new code and a new copyright?

This is where a "donated" copyright to a legal entity would help...

What you might do with an entity such as an executable including but not
limited to distributing, modifying, running, etc., is generically referred
to as usage.

You shouldn't make baseless statements like that. *Adding* or *removing*
*any* *language* when applied to a legal document (such as the GPL), is
indeed considered a modification. The Harbour Exception *does* create a new
modified version of the GPL. I would strongly recommend that you consult
with a legal expert before making such statements.

Consider Usage a synonym of Activities.

The GPL does generally speak about *use*. From GPL (section 0):

"The act of running the Program is not restricted"

Activities (like coping, distributing, and modifying) and/or and actions
(like running) are all considered usage. Further, our Exception is an
integral part of the Harbour License and reads:

"Your use of that executable is in no way restricted"
      ^^^

> Perhaps you're speaking about distribution?

No, I was talking about usage which is a slightly broader term. Most
Software are accompanied by a "User License". Such document aim to described
what usage of the software is valid. The GPL while not labeled "User
License" still is exactly that.

Technically. once code exists and is copyrighted to an entity, all 
subsequent edits of that code are derivative works, regardless of 
the added detail. All derivative works are still copyrighted to the 
original owner.

Remember, folks...

Other than getting the GPL + Harbour Exception on those six 
modules, we are not taking any action yet.

My proposal is that Dave and I take all the existing arguments and 
discussions into consideration and draft another license that we 
will come back to the table with.

This will allow the coders to continue concentrating on what they 
are doing while Dave and I hammer out a new proposed license.

I just love how the ideas have flowed in this project.

There are brilliant minds at work here.

Thank you all!

Just to be clear, did he make the offer he's made before that was asking if
harbour wanted to be part of the GNU project, or did he ask if all the
harbour developers wanted to sign over their copyright. There's a
difference. When he first extended an offer to us it was to ask if we wanted
to join the harbour project.

Yes, I said that. It seems clear to me that use and distribution of the
application is unhindered because the licence and exception are in force,
not because they've ceased to be in force.

Here's a different way to consider it, perhaps your legal adviser might like
to ponder it too. If someone decompiles a harbour built executable have they
manager to find a way of removing the GPL from the GPLd source code?

I forget to re-mail this to the developers list. In addition to the six
files David found the above need proper headers adding. Can the copyright
holders of these files please assert their copyright and apply the GPL plus
harbour exception?

What's up with you Ron Pinkas? Why do you keep trying to tell the world that
I say things for no reason?

No it doesn't. Show me where we've modified the text of the GPL. Show me
where the GPL is different in harbour than it is anywhere else.

I don't need to do that Ron, I can see with my own eyes that we've not
modified the GPL. Is your legal advisor telling you this even though you've
not shown him the harbour exception and how it is applied?

You want to show him it all before you go accusing people have making
"baseless" statements. You might also want to apologise for making such
accusations too.

This is why I said "generally". You might have noticed that the GPL is
mostly concerned with distribution of binaries and the making of derivative
works. That's all I was saying.

I did already think of that myself too. He explains that while such someone
might try to claim that "Your use of that executable is in no way
restricted", allows such "use", the (U.S.) legal system doesn't consider
decompiling a "use", but rather abuse.

Hmm, although that does give some "protection" it isn't really helpful is
it. It decompilation of an executable that you *own* (as opposed to own a
licence for) really abuse? I find that hard to believe.

Put another way, if I build an application with harbour, loose the source
code, use a harbour decompiler to get *my* source back, why is that seen as
abuse. Also, as a side effect to that, I've also got a load of source that
used to be under the GPL. Is it still under the GPL now that it's been
"washed" by my application and the decompiler? I'd have thought not, it's a
derivative work. If it's still under the copyright of the various harbour
copyright holders it then begs the question: what licence exists for it now?

If the GPL still exists for it it would seem that the licence existed
post-build, and that the exception existed post-build too.

He wanted both.

Here is the text he sent. The first paragraph speaks to becoming 
part of GNU, the last paragraph mentions donating the copyright.

I did write back to him and explain that it's not a database 
package, but a language and compiler that can use databases.

Would you like to make this database package GNU software?  
Here's an explanation of what it means for a program to be GNU 
software:

=================================================
=====================
Calling a program GNU software means that its developers and the 
GNU project agree that "This program is part of the GNU project, 
released under the aegis of GNU"--and say so in the program.

This means that we normally put the program on ftp.gnu.org 
(although we could instead refer to the developer's choice of ftp 
site) and that we put the official pages describing the program on 
the GNU web server.  (It is ok to have more informal pages about 
secondary issues, such as discussion meant for people who want 
to help develop the package, on some other site.)

It means that the developers agree to pay some attention to 
making the program work well with the rest of the GNU system--
and conversely that the GNU project will encourage other GNU 
maintainers to pay some attention to making their programs fit in 
well with it.

Just what it means to make programs work well together is mainly 
a practical matter that depends on what the program does.  But 
there are a few general principles.  Certain parts of the GNU coding 
standards directly affect the consistency of the whole system.  
These include the standards for configuring and building a program, 
and the standards for command-line options.  It is important to 
make all GNU programs follow these standards, where they are 
applicable.

Another important GNU standard is that GNU programs should 
come with documentation in Texinfo format.  That is the GNU 
standard documentation format, and it can be converted 
automatically into various other formats.

If a GNU program wants to be extensible, it should use GUILE 
(http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html) as the programming 
language for extensibility--that is the GNU standard extensibility 
package.  If the program doesn't use GUILE today, at least there 
should be a firm plan to support it in the future.

A GNU program should not recommend use of any non-free 
program, and it should not refer the user to any non-free 
documentation for free software.  The need for free documentation 
to go with free software is now a major focus of the GNU project; to 
show that we are serious about the need for free documentation, 
we must not contradict our position by recommending use of 
documentation that isn't free.

Occasionally there are issues of terminology which are important 
for the success of the GNU project as a whole.  So we ask 
maintainers of GNU programs to follow them.  For example, the 
documentation files and comments in the program should speak of 
Linux-based GNU systems or GNU/Linux systems, rather than 
calling the whole system "Linux", and should use the term "free 
software" rather than "open source".

Deciding that a program is GNU software does not necessarily 
require transferring copyright to the FSF; that is a separate 
question.  If you transfer the copyright to the FSF, the FSF will 
enforce the GPL for the program if someone violates it; if you keep 
the copyright, enforcement will be up to you.

Because you did. You clearly stated:

"The "harbour license" isn't a modified version of the GPL."

That is absolutely false in the legal sense, because the GPL + Harbour
Exception == Modified version of the GPL. If it wasn't modified we could
have used the GPL *without* such exception.

I did clearly state that I *did* show him the Exception, why would you
miss-state this fact too?

I *did* "show it all". I only accused you of doing what you clearly did. You
claimed:

"The "harbour license" isn't a modified version of the GPL."

When in fact it is. I specifically suggested that you seek legal advice
about this very fact, before making such statements.

No that's *not* *all* you were saying. 3 different times you were
questioning, the use of the term "use". Where as I explained, it is
perfectly appropriate in the context it was used.

No Dave, decompiling code that you own is not abuse, but if you already have
access to the source like in the case of the HVM and HRL, it's just plain
waste of time.

It is my understanding that decompiled code is subject to the exact same
copyright protection it claimed at its most recent prior copyright notice.

I'm told the GPL + Exception exists from the moment the executable was
created. Use of this executable is forever subject to terms of this HGPL*.

The fact that you see such an action as a waste of time is beside the point.
If someone were to decompile their own executable the harbour sources would
be reproduced as a side effect. That can't be ignored or dismissed as a
"plain waste of time". It's something that could happen.

The GPL plus exception exists prior to that too, although I think I see what
you mean here (the exception doesn't kick in until that point, right?).

So we actually agree then?

Ahh, ok, that's the boilerplate that they send out. I'm not sure that the

I also clearly stated, in the sentence prior to that one:

`----

It isn't a modified version of the GPL. The content of the file COPYING has
in no way been modified. Furthermore, the "harbour licence" uses the pure
GPL in most circumstances. The harbour exception is an agreement between the
copyright holder an a user of that code that absolves them from observing
the GPL for a given "use".

The GPL has not been modified, the "harbour licence" isn't a modified
version of the GPL, the file COPYING is unmolested.

I'm still having a hard time seeing how what I'm saying is "baseless" when
I've actually thought about this and what I'm saying has a basis. Perhaps
you'd be so kind to drop the argumentative tone and actually look at what
I'm writing?

I can see that your legal advisor has given you legal advice and that you
believe his advice. I can also see that the GPL hasn't been modified, these
two facts don't fit, hence the reason I'm pointing this out and asking about
it so we can all learn.

You, on the other hand, seem to want to try and convince the world that I
have no good firm reasons for asking what I'm asking. What purpose does that
serve Ron Pinkas?

I'd have a hard time disagreeing with this. You'll note, however, that it
doesn't say that the GPL has been modified.

That's a question, not a statement. I'm asking if you've shown him the
exception. I'm glad to since read that you have done so.

I'll say it again, I don't need to seek legal advice, I can see that the GPL
hasn't been modified in any way and I can see that all of our code is
covered by the GPL in it's unmodified form, include the HVM and HRTL.
Failing that, can you show me the version of COPYING that is different from
the GPL has found on the FSF web site?

Yes, I asked for clarification and I also pointed out that the GPL is very
much concerned with distribution. The problem with this is?

I forgot to ask: So, it does seem that the copyright survives compilation
and decompilation, I expected that. Does it follow the licence survives
decompilation (keeping in mind that, AFAIK (IANAL), a copyright notice is a
very different thing from a licence) too?

If the licence terms do survive decompilation doesn't this suggest that the
GPL is still "active" all along and that the exception is "active" in
"protecting" the non-free code from the GPL?

I seem to have come back in the middle of the discussion here. I'll
summarise the current points that I've seen, can someone please 
correct me if I'm wrong on anything.

1. Currently, changing code like errorsys.prg, getsys.prg will require
   that those portions of code be made available under the GPL, as
   the modified versions are covered under the GPL+Harbour exception.
   This is not desirable.

2. The GPL+Harbour exception is OK for the original purpose (allowing
   people to create non-free programs using Harbour and the Harbour
   libraries) without them having to GPL the code that they are
   compiling, as long as they don't include modified Harbour code.

So what we want, is for people to be able to modify units like
errorsys.prg, getsys.prg without having to GPL their modifications.

So, the questions I have.

Is the existing GPL+Harbour exception OK for the "core" harbour code?

Why don't we identify units that we want people to be able to modify
& include in their own program without them being subject to our 
licence and put them in the public domain? 

Take errorsys.prg. People should be able to modify it and include
it in their programs. There is no problem with putting it in the
public domain, as we don't care if people include it in non-free
software.

Please. Tell me if I'm seeing this too simply. It's hard to see through
Ron & Dave arguments to see if they have found a fundamental flaw in
the harbour exception, or if they are just trying to bend it to allow
units like errorsys to be used in a non-free manner.

But this is exactly the problem, you make a statement with legal context
based on literal context. This is flawed. From the legal standpoint, (GPL is
a legal document) adding any text which is attached to or applied to a legal
document, effectively modifies such document.

The License which any Harbour Application is covered by, is *not* the GPL,
it is a version of the GPL which is derived from the original GPL *plus* the
Harbour Exception.

Have you read what you just wrote? "Most cases"?

This is where you keep ignoring what is no more than a simple legal reality.
License X + any additional text, is no longer License X. I don't know how to
repeat it in any clearer terms. Even if the addition text only effected
0.00000000001% of circumstances.

What has basis in your unqualified opinion does not necessarily qualify as
legal basis. Your difficulty is arising exactly from your willingness to
argue a legal point without the legal qualifications.

How is the saying, "If Two conflicting realities appear correct, at least
one of them must be false"?

Your claim that the Harbour License is not a modified version of the GPL is
100% false.

You claim that you "point it out and asking, so that we can all learn", but
yet you decline to accept the professional opinion of a qualified expert as
valid. You have not explained why makes you qualified to refute such
qualified opinion.

The only way you can resolve your conflict, is by seeking professional
advise, that you should be willing to accept. I did suggest this before, and
you continually declined.

You were not asking, you were making unqualified claims, and definitive
statements which were absolutely false.

It serve the purpose of correcting the wrong impression you insisted on
conveying, even after I tried to provide you with the qualified information,
you should have relied upon.

You keep insisting on not seeing what is clearly in front of you. I'm afraid
you'll have to ask others, as I did my best and failed.

It is a problem with implementation of  OutXXX() functions in Unix
environment. Currently to manipulate screen (beter say a terminal)
gt layer uses either curses or slang library which put terminal to a
"raw" mode with no LF translation. In console.c both hb_conOutStd()
and hb_conOutErr() use hb_fsWriteLarge() to write directly to a file
descriptor outside either curses or slang library, so they can not
track all screen writes this way. This leads for example to problems
with Dos CRLF and Unix LF new line markers. Simple lines :

OutStd( " This is a first line " + hb_osNewLine() )
OutStd( " This is a second line " + hb_osNewLine() )

will work ok on Dos but fail on Unix because both line feed and carriage
return will be written to screen on Dos, setting cursor in a proper place,
and on Unix only line feed will be sent moving cursor down and not forcing
it to a begin of line.
Because libraries can not track all screen writes some screen output done
by OutXXX() funcs may be discarded during library refresh screen operations.

Another problem with using screen management libraries (I should
say - with controling terminals) in Unix environment is redirecting output
from stdout and stderr to a file or a pipe. Terminals are controled via
sequences of control characters which are sent to them and these
sequences simply are redirected too, causing redirection unuseable
at all.

Try redirecting simple program :

PROCEDURE Main()
    OutStd( " This is a redirection " + hb_osNewLine() )
RETURN

to a file and see that file. You'll see what I mean.

While I'm not against this approach, I think it leaves a lot to be

That's one way to get there, and perhaps the most obvios parts 
should be treated this way such as errorsys and getsys.

Ok, it's a year from now and I'm writing some code to compile with 
Harbour and I want to do something with a part of the RTL that 
hasn't been identified in the list of 'sanctioned code' that I can 
modify.

Now what?

Do I try to find the author and get his permission to modify his work 
without invoking the GPL?

Do I ignore it and break the law?

Do I rewrite the code that I wanted to borrow and modify because 
modification of the code I want to borrow is not sanctioned?

Do I try to get the developers to add my features the to base set?

This is what I was referring to when I requested this conversation 
and asked to not create a list that delineates which modules can 
and which modules can't be modified and included, but instead a 
general rule that identifies them without letting all the cows out of 
the barn at the same time. (getting us ripped off because we 
loosened a huge loophole).

While it may seem convenient to identify a list of source code that 
we are sanctioned to modify and include, we have never before had 
the privilege of having the entire code base at our disposal. (re CA-
Clipper or any other commercial product) This makes it difficult to 
draw the line since we don't have much experience in what will be 
useful to modify and include at some point in the future.

For example, should we allow someone to modify the object 
system? How about the way arrays are populated?

It's going to be really hard to identify just which code should be 
subject to inclusion and modification without invoking the GPL. If 
we create a list of limits, we could be stifling innovation.

This is why I wanted to create a general rule instead of a list.

Something like:

Commonnly modified modules in the Harbour Project source code 
have not been licensed via the GPL license, but were instead 
placed in the public domain. Feel free to modify these and include 
them in in your source code while still maintaining the Harbour 
Exception clause to the GPL license.

You may also include and modify as many as three other RTL and 
VM source code modules without invoking the GPL license.

I'm not even suggesting that this is a solution, but just to illustrate 
the idea of creating a general rule instead of a list. The exception to 
this is that you cannot use this exception to create a commercial 
compiler.

It seem the worldtime site maintainers change numbers in land=... every time
they add a new country. More like it's just the number of the country in the
alphabetical order. If I am right, all the worldtime links should be
removed.

I'm not arguing a legal point Ron, I'm simply making a statement of fact.
We've not modified the GPL.

Oh God, here we go again, Ron Pinkas and his inane attempts at bullying.
Ron, can't you begin to understand that I don't have to be qualified, in any
way, shape or form, to see that we've not changed one single word of the
GPL? Can't you see that such an observation, no matter anyone's
qualification, will cause those who are curious to ask for clarification?

What I don't understand is why, if you've got to the trouble of taking legal
advice, you're not willing to share it to it's fully extent and explain why
we have modified the GPL? So far you've simply stated that we have and have
then claimed argument-by-qualification as your reasoning.

I've asked for clarification, I've been honest and polite enough to document
where my confusion may be and you come up with the crap about.

In my native language (English) a question mark means that the preceding

If you really did take legal advice I would have thought that your "best"
would have exceeded "because I would told so". If you are not in a position
to explain further then, obviously, you're more than welcome to say that you
can't.

Modify the code, and release your modified version of Harbour with the
existing Licence. Then compile your code with the version of Harbour.
That is what the GPL is for. To stop people doing exactly what you are 
Talking about. We don't really want people modifing the core without
making those changes available under the GPL.

We do allow people to modify the object system, as long as they 
release their changes under the same licence that we use. They are
getting all our work for free, why should they be able to change it
and not let us see their changes.

Why not use Ca-Clipper as a guide. Release those units that CA released
with Clipper, and put the in the Public domain.
Anything else that people want to do with Harbour, is most likely 
going to benefit everybody who uses Harbour, so they should be
made available under the GPL.

The GPL does not require you to release your code to everybody. It 
requires you to release your code to whoever you make a binary version
available to. If you are selling an application to somebody, you don't
have to make your changes available to the world, just to the person
you have given your binary to. The only thing you can't do is stop
them passing on the source to whoever they choose. A developer working
closly with a client and writing bespoke software is not going to be
bothered about giving a small portion of their source code to the 
client.

IMHO, releasing some units that we know will need to be modified 
(like errorsys) into the public domain, and leaving the rest as it
is, would be the best plan. Anything else and you are risking reducing
the freedom of people who want to use Harbour.

E.G. Somebody releases a library that enables the use of a graphical
toolkit on Windows & Linux/*BSD. To do this, they modify a part of the
harbour internals. If a licence like the one you are suggesting is
in force, they could release this "new" part of harbour as binary only.
They could then require you to use their copy of harbour, as it is the
only one that their "new" internal unit will work with.

Subject: [Harbour] Bug with oError:args as received by an error handler
Message-ID: <20010304163057.G21816@hagbard.davep.org>

I was just having a bit more of a play with Ron's PP.PRG to check that his
latest round of changes worked fine in a harbour built on a GNU/Linux box
and found that it kept crashing if I put in "nonsense" commands. It kept
dying in the error handler.

After a bit of digging it seems that the :args instance variable isn't
getting populated correctly when an error occurs in "harbour space". Take
this code for example:

-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------
Function Main()

   errorblock( {|o| MyErrHandler( o ) } )

   ? 2 + NIL
   
Return( NIL )

Function MyErrHandler( o )

   ? valtype( o:args )
   Quit

Return( NIL )
-- cut here ----------------------------------------------------------------

The screen output should be "A", and it is with CA-Clipper. With harbour
however the output is "N". It seems that :args is set to a numeric value (I
get 0 with the above test code) when it should be an array.

Hence the reason that PP.PRG kept dying on this line:

,----[ Line 765 ]
|       FOR Counter := 1 TO Len( oError:Args )

I don't know which C compiler/platform combinations this affects but it's a
problem with GCC on my Linux box and, I guess, GCC on any platform. It might
also be a problem with other compilers too as it's a C symbol name thing.

Take the following fully correct Clipper program:

,----[ foo-bar.prg ]
| ? "Hello, World!"
`----

Note the name, that's the important bit. This compiles, links and runs just
fine with CA-Clipper.

However, with harbour/gcc/Linux it chokes at the C compilation stage, the
reason should be fairly obvious:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ gharbour foo-bar
| Harbour Compiler 0.35j (Build 35) (2000.11.30) (Flex)
| Copyright 1999-2000, http://www.harbour-project.org
| Compiling 'foo-bar.prg'...
| Lines 3, Functions/Procedures 1
| Generating C source output to 'foo-bar.c'... Done.
| foo-bar.c:11: parse error before `-'
| foo-bar.c:16: `HB_FUN_FOO' undeclared here (not in a function)
| foo-bar.c:16: `BAR' undeclared here (not in a function)
| foo-bar.c:16: initializer element for `symbols[0].pFunPtr' is not constant
| foo-bar.c:18: parse error before `-'
| foo-bar.c:32: parse error before `-'
| foo-bar.c:46: warning: parameter names (without types) in function declaration
| foo-bar.c:46: conflicting types for `hb_vmExecute'

| foo-bar.c:46: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
| foo-bar.c:47: parse error before `}'
`----

the reason being:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ grep FOO-BAR foo-bar.c
|        HB_FUNC( FOO-BAR );
| HB_INIT_SYMBOLS_BEGIN( hb_vm_SymbolInit_FOO-BAR )
| { "FOO-BAR", HB_FS_PUBLIC | HB_FS_FIRST, HB_FUNCNAME( FOO-BAR ), NULL },
| HB_INIT_SYMBOLS_END( hb_vm_SymbolInit_FOO-BAR )
|    static HB_$INITSYM hb_vm_auto_SymbolInit_FOO-BAR = hb_vm_SymbolInit_FOO-BAR;
|    #pragma startup hb_vm_SymbolInit_FOO-BAR
| HB_FUNC( FOO-BAR )
`----

You can't have a "-" in a symbol name in C.

Subject: [Harbour] GPL + Exception -> Legal Interpretation
Message-ID: <200103041221_MC2-C789-4A44@compuserve.com>

Ron & Dave,

I think your apparent misunderstanding centres round whether the
Harbour Exception has modified the GPL.

As I see it, it's so obvious that we haven't changed the actual file
(COPYING or whatever) that Ron cannot mean that.  Instead, he / his
lawyer is referring to modification in a legal sense.

It doesn't seem unreasonable that the law in at least some countries
can speak of a modification as being either physical or conceptual
(or both).  A will quite commonly is modified by a codicil (one or
more extra pages, usually added later).  No physical modification
takes place (and indeed such a thing would risk invalidating the
will).

So, I can accept that the Harbour Exception (+GPL) is overall a
modified GPL.

The difference I'm seeing here, and am attempting to get a handle on, is
that the exception itself doesn't appear to modify the GPL, it simply says
when you don't need to apply it (the GPL that is). I'm not convinced that
the GPL is modified in anyway way, be it physically or otherwise.

There's also the small matter of the GPL being under copyright so I'm also
not sure how this talk of modification sits with the fact that we've not
asked the copyright holder of that document if we can "modify" it.

You and me both. Perhaps someone with access to legal advice in the US and
who is willing to accept that I'm asking questions out of interest might
want to step forward and satisfy our curiosity?

Dave, it is not a statement of fact, it is only your opinion. This argument
will never hold in court of law, because you don't need to literally modify
a legal document, in order to get a modified version of it.

Consider the following, ABC publishes a Version 1.0 of License X, Some time
later, ABC publishes Version 1.1 of License X. It reads as follows:

,-----------
|This is Version 1.1 of License X. All terms and condition of Version 1.0
apply, with the |addition of new section 10. as follows:
|
|10. This is Section 10, we have just modified License X, without ever
touching it. You are |no longer subject to sections 1, 3, and 5, if you own
product Y.
`-----------

Adding the Harbour Exception, created a New (modified) License, which can no
longer be refer d to as the GPL, because it isn't. It is a new License based
on the GPL + some additional text.

How do you recommend I share more than I did? I did forward clear
statements, indicating, that any addition or removal of text, attached or
applied to a legal document, is in effect modifying it. I did try to
explain, that you don't need to modify or even have access to the original,
in order to create a modified version of such. I did try to explain, that
you seem to insist on the literal meaning of the word modify, which is
indeed different in a legal context.

Dave, I was referring to the many definitive statements you made ending with
a period, not a question mark. For sake of brevity, I'll not re-quote them
yet again.

Assume, you are in a court of law, and you are asked under oath:

,----
|Is the Harbour Application subject to the GPL, Yes or No?
`----

I hope you understand, you can *not* answer "Yes", and be truthful, yet you
can't answer "Yes, but..." either. The *only* truthful answer in court of
law, will have to be "No".

That's because the Harbour Application is subject to a modified version of
the GPL, equaling the "sum" of the GPL plus the Harbour Exception.

Legal modification, does not equal literal modification.

Dave,

Yes, I noticed that, and had changed PP code as a result :-(.

I also did bring this subject up few months back. If you remember, I offered
a quick solution, but Victor explained, that a different approach will work
better.

Many of the incompatibilities reported by HBTEST are the result of this
problem. I sure hope someone will take it upon themselves to address this.

FWIW, it's a very simple fix.

No, what I state there is a fact. COPYING hasn't been modified in any way.
I'm then working out from there.

So you do agree that the GPL hasn't been modified and that the harbour
licence isn't a modified GPL? All I'm saying, and seeking clarification
about, is that we seem to have a set of rules for telling people when the
unmolested GPL should be applied.

I'm not sure why such questions or such a desire for clarification would be
met with such hostile responses. I'm especially interested in why you'd go
shouting "baseless" when even you now seem to be noticing that the GPL
hasn't been changed.

Let me refresh your memory:

You're clearly referring to my words about your legal advisor and those

caused you to not quote this exchange?

A friend is interesting in looking at another project hosted by

web-languages, but not C.

To get the cvs tree, she'll have to use the command line CVS like I/we
use for Harbour, but there is also win32-versions.

For ease of use and setup, does anyone have an opinion of the one vs the

Let's go back to my court of law scenario, why won't you answer?

How do you arrive at this, Dave? Let's read again:

,----
| Adding the Harbour Exception, created a New (modified) License,
|                               ^^^^^^^   ^^^  ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^

| It is a new License based on the GPL + some additional text.
|         ^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^        ^^^ ^
`----

Here is the clarification you seek:

A set of rules (or any other text) when *added* to any agreement,
effectively modifies such agreement. In the court of law this action is
considered a modification.

> I'm not sure why such questions or such a desire for

Can you please point me to where have I been hostile? I can easily point you
to numerous occasions in this exchange, where you accused me of "Ignorance",
"Bullying", used a teacher like, preaching tone "Ron Pinkas", etc.. I was
not hostile for the simple, reason, that your defensiveness have earned my
curiosity, and interest, but no other emotions, I'm aware of.

> I'm especially interested in why you'd go
> shouting "baseless" when even you now seem to be noticing that the GPL

This is just as baseless a claim, as your original claims. Are *you* willing
to ignore, baseless, claims, on such critical subject?

> You're clearly referring to my words about your legal advisor and those
> words clearly end with a question mark. Are you sure it was brevity that

Here are few of your baseless claims, and definitive statements, ending with
period rather than question mark:

This is how it got started Dave:

| You shouldn't make baseless statements like that. *Adding* or *removing*
| *any* *language* when applied to a legal document (such as the GPL), is

If I can do this than I can modify Harbour until it is no longer

Why not use CA-Clipper as a guide? Because they are a poor

Yes, that is true, but at the same time, they will have created a 
fork of the code, which is their right. Now, they have a maintenance 
nightmare. The original code base continues to forge ahead and 
theirs get's left behind. Eventually developers will choose the most 
advanced one.

And, if you're not a developer, what's the difference?

I think you're taking Matthew's suggesting out of context here. He's not
suggesting that we take open source hints and guidance from CA, he's
suggesting the same thing that I and others have suggested: the list of
sources that were supplied by Nantucket/CA for the CA-Clipper system
libraries are a good guide as to which parts of the HRTL might do well to be
in the public domain (or at least under a more permissive licence).

Won't answer? This is the first time I've seen this "law scenario". Why have
you decided that I "won't" answer it before I've even seen it? Furthermore,
why would you try and tell the readership of this list that I won't answer
it?

At best that's terribly presumptuous of you and at worst that's simply
dishonest.

Assuming the question you say I "won't" answer is the boxed question: my
answer would be "which application are you talking about and where did all
the sources come from that were used to build it". I'd also seek
clarification as to what they meant when they said "harbour application"
(I'd also want to know where in the world this court was and why I was there
and being asked such a question).

I would, however, answer Yes *and* No if we're talking about an application
built using harbour and incorporating the HVM and HRTL. From what you've
said previously about your own opinion and the legal advice you've received
it seems that you'd give exactly the same answer.

Think about the decompilation issue.

I don't doubt or disagree that the agreement you see at the top of our HVM
files is different from those you see at the top the compiler files (for
example).

Claiming that I was writing "false and misleading" things when I said that
DJGPP was a good example of a GPLd body of code that attempted to solve the
problem we've been trying to solve. Dismissing my feedback about your ideas
regarding the exception as "attributing to me invented intentions" and "a
fiction of your imagination". Banging on about how what I'd written was
"totally false" when I said that the GPL and the harbour exception existed
after linking, only for you to try and argue the exact same thing to me just
24hrs later. Claiming that I won't answer a question that I've just seen for
the first time (see above).

You can add to that list the dishonesty you've added below.

Accused you of ignorance? You were obviously ignorant of how DJGPP is put
together otherwise you wouldn't have said it was based on GCC and GLIBC. How
could you possibly see this as a negative thing? Do you think "ignorant" is
an insult or something?

Hmm, so this is the question you're claiming I "won't" answer. Curious that
I "won't" answer it when it appears that I've only just seen the original,
right after the copy.

So I gather (in the US at least, possibly in the UK as well). However, I've
not actually seen anything that demonstrates that we've modified the GPL in
any way. I can see that we have, in a legal sense, a licence that is based
on the GPL but the GPL is still there, out licence tells people when they
don't need to observe it.

No, I understand completely. Then, I remember how many of us 
tried to reverse engineer the parts they wouldn't give us access to 
so we could do more, get more, stretch edges, etc.

In this light, I think they are a poor example of what to let people 
modify and what not to.

But, they do present a beginning.

Can you think of a good list of "extras", bits that people needed access to
so they could improve their applications (I don't think hack-libraries like
Clip4Win and FiveW*n count here)?

Personally I can see *large* parts of the RTL would fall into this category.
This suggests that, ideally, the RTL would be much more useful if it had a
far more permissive licence.

True, harbour already provides more source that can be freely changed (all
of it's source) and some parts, which CA never gave you access to, can be
included, in modified form, in non-free applications without any licence
implications. ACHOICE.PRG, ALERT.PRG and MENUTO.PRG are good examples. Some
really generous individuals were kind enough to donate them to the public
domain, which makes life easier for everyone.

It does strike me that this is a prime candidate for Phil's FIXME list (the
idea being that the next release of harbour happen pretty quickly and simply
include fixes).

Dave,

"COPYING hasn't been modified in any way. I'm then working out from

I have to say I don't see why, but that's not the point.  COPYING
_has_ been modified from a legal POV, which does not require it to be
a physical mod.

"So you do agree that the GPL hasn't been modified and that the harbour
licence isn't a modified GPL?"

Neither.  It has been modified and it is a modified GPL.  At least, as
a non-lawyer it looks true to me and Ron's lawyer says so.

"All I'm saying, and seeking clarification about, is that we seem to
have a set of rules for telling people when the unmolested GPL should
be applied."

Fine - sounds useful.

No problem.  AFAIK all that matters is that the changes are made

I'm not sure how long they have to be available - it sort of sounds

Dave,

"The difference I'm seeing here, and am attempting to get a handle on, is=

that the exception itself doesn't appear to modify the GPL, it simply say=
s
when you don't need to apply it (the GPL that is)."

I expect from a legal POV that's a modification.  It refers to it,
and when it does & doesn't apply.  Probably qualifies (as a mod. from
a legal POV) on all counts.

"I'm not convinced that the GPL is modified in anyway way, be it
physically or otherwise."

I wouldn't say I'm 100% convinced, but enough (98%?) to work on the
basis that it is.

"There's also the small matter of the GPL being under copyright"

Not small.  Well... maybe it is in the sense that it would be a major
oddity for FSF/RMS to be about freedom but not allow the Harbour way,
especially in view of emails with RMS.

A lawyer would probably strongly recommend getting _written_
permission, _signed_ by an authorised (legally, that is)
representative of the copyright owner (FSF).

I'd be happy with what we have, I suppose because it feels (ethically,
morally, whatever) OK and RMS & FSF are "into" that, plus RMS has been
made aware of the Exception, and in addition it's been OK'ed for GUILE.

If we deal more with lawyers and end up convinced that it's not quite
the right Exception, I think we should at least run any revised one
past RMS/FSF. :-)

"I'm also not sure how this talk of modification sits with the fact
that we've not asked the copyright holder of that document if we can
"modify" it."

It's "probably" OK to not physically modify it (i.e. refer to it as is
done).  However, "probably" is not the kind of situation a lawyer
would be likely to recommend one stays in having raised it!

Ron's trying. :-)

And yes, that does have two meanings. :-) :-)

However, I think Ron actually _is_ willing to find out.  We can all
help keep the costs down if we can figure out careful questions to
ask, with explanations (motivation for asking, background info, etc)
I would think.  E.g. I'm less than convinced that the lawyer's views
so far are correct but I'm struggling to come up with the right way
to dig to find why / why not. :-(

Could I (gulp! is this too big a risk?) possibly ask both you and Ron
to drop (better: forget <g>) large parts of this thread?  Y'know: the
ones not entirely on-topic.  Or whatever euphemism I mean.  Both of
you could instead help to figure out the exact questions we should be
asking. :-)

Sure, I can see how it could be seen that way from a legal point of view in
one or more countries. I don't think I've said that it couldn't be seen that
way. All I've been trying to find out and document is my confusion about
this point of view and, also, that we've not actually modified the GPL
itself. My concern about the last bit being the issue that the GPL itself is
a document that is under copyright.

So Ron's lawyer is, in effect, saying that there are two distinct versions
of the GPL at play when the exception is in place?

Simply making the changes available doesn't absolve someone from the GPL.
It's the GPL that means they have to make the changes available *if* they
distribute the binary.

No, my understanding is that there is one license HGPL which is a version of
the GPL excluding all restrictions.

Please note, at this point it appears this is only true for only non
modified HVM & HRL.

I'm told Decompilation, is not an issue, because the source for these
components is freely available. But, such decompiled source is covered by
the GPL but rather than the HGPL, because the exception is only alive for
executables.

Not forwarding the Arguments down the Error Handling chain, to the point

The GPL covers all of Harbour, when in source form. Only the HGPL is active
(covers) application, where the compiled HVM/HRL are the only reliance of
such application on Harbour.

This is still where I'm confused by this modified-GPL business, it seems to
me that creating a derived work of an item of source[1] in the HRTL "wipes"
the exception from the file. Or, at least, it can be interpreted that way,
the idea being that it's the copyright holder who gets to offer the
exception, the author of a derived work can't do that on behalf of the
copyright holder.

So, and this is my confusion, if, legally, in some country or other, the
exception is seen as a modification to the GPL itself, does that mean that
creating a derived work creates yet another licence that happens to be
exactly like the GPL or does it mean that the GPL was always there but the
exception no longer applies?

IOW, from where I'm sat, it strikes me that the harbour "licence" isn't so
much a modified version of the GPL, it's more of an IF.THEN.ELSE statement.

No matter how this is viewed, either in US law or from a layman's point of
view, the important thing I wanted to stress and have been trying to stress
is that we're not changing the wording of the GPL itself and that the GPL is
always there and is the primary licence. The exception is an agreement
between the user who wants to write non-free software and the copyright
holder of any given file in the HVM/HRTL.

I think there might be a word missing from that last sentence (or perhaps
there's a word or two too many), it seems to be saying that the source is
covered by both the GPL *and* the HGPL[2] but it also says that the
exception only applies to executables (agreed) which suggests that the
"HGPL" doesn't count for the decompiled source.

Regarding "decompiled code doesn't count", the decompiled code wouldn't
generally look anything like the original code, it'd be, in effect, a
translation of the original. Is it correct to say that it doesn't count when
it would appear that it's a derived work? Is it a derived work? Does a
translation have a different status from a derived work?

In the grand scheme of things I guess none of this really matters too much,
but it's nice to try and get a handle on it. I'm still wondering if it'll
really help or if it'll be far too much work and effort to try and tighten
up the exception to defeat MegaEvilNastyCorpIncLtdPLCGmbH when what's
probably more important is that we do everything possible to make life
easier for those who want to modify key parts of the RTL but still
distribute their own code as non-free software.

-----
[1]  Which is under the GPL plus harbour exception, I'm obviously not
thinking of the public domain files here.

[2]  I'm not sure that it's a good idea to start referring to something
called the HGPL, that seems like a possible route to even more confusion.
I've never seen anything calling itself the GGPL when used in connection
with guile for example (although the FSF's licences page doesn't help
matters because it suggests that the GPL plus the guile exception is another
kind of licence but doesn't actually say so, if you follow my meaning).

It hadn't arrived here by that time, I didn't see it until this morning.
Perhaps you should have asked why I "didn't" answer instead?

As a distribution, yes, as individual files, no. Some files are in the
public domain.

I'm still not clear what the cause of the problem is. Also, where does it
get it's numeric value from? I'd have thought that if it was a failure to
populate :args then that instance variable would have been NIL, not a
numeric value.

Aw, heck, why don't we just check again with Stallman on this?

Personally: I'm not 100% sure what my own question is, or, rather, how to
pose it.

Far from it, guile would appear to have had a similar "problem" and it
tackled it one way, DJGPP too, it tackled it another.

Good point.

Hmmm.  More than one solution.  Should be easy.

Doh! It's obvious when you look in the obvious place (the terror known as
terror). Might someone currently configured with full CVS access be kind
enough to apply the attached patch?

No, what we are looking for is more like "You may also include and
modify as many as three other HRL and HVM source code modules while
retaining the protection of the Harbour Exception to the GPL for your
resulting executable." We *never* want to imply that the GPL does not
apply.

Ok eck, am I being bitten by your MUA's lack of an In-Reply-To header (your
emails don't thread well at this end, it's hard to follow the thread of
discussion).

I thought the concern that Phil was raising is that someone who wants to
modify parts of the HRTL can't use their modified version in their own
non-free application if they can't get their code accepted by the copyright
holder of the file concerned.

So, I was pointing out (agreeing with you?) that making their changes
available won't allow them to use that code in a non-free application.

Possibly. ;>

No, what you said was right, what I was saying is that someone finding
themselves in the situation described above won't be able to get out of the
situation by making their changes available.

Probably.

Actually, the only truthful answer is, "Yes." Because even if the
application qualifies for the Harbour Exception, the exception only
exempts the application from a small section of the GPL.

I cannot fathom why you or your lawyer claim that the Harbour Exception
exempts the appliction from the entire GPL, because that is simply not
the case.

Actually, the Harbour compiler and all libraries are always covered by
the GPL. The Harbour Exception does not change how the GPL applies to
the source or binary code for any part of Harbour.

The Harbour Exception only applies to an application that has been
created from Harbour, so that the mere act of linking in the HRL and/or
HVM won't force you to GPL that application (but other things could
still force you to GPL your application).

Having a quick read of some more source I think I know what you mean now.
Are you saying that no part of harbour is actually *populating* :args *at*
the point of the error (I was looking at what happens in hb_vmPlus() as an
example)?

I think I can see the obvious thing to do here but I'm cautious about taking
it any further in light of what you said about previous conversations. Is
the exchange you had in mind in the current list archives? Failing that,
could you possibly summarise what the objection to your method was?

1. I though that in your native language a question mark indicates a
question not a statement. Therefore it should be clear that I told the list
nothing of the sort, I rather asked you a question.

2. I did ask the question, because the unanswered question I referred to,
was posted before a subsequent message to which you did reply.

(As I expected) No, because "Yes and No" equals "No".

> Think about the decompilation issue.

All of the files which include the Exception are covered by what I my
attorney referred to as HGPL, which is the GPL + Exception, regardless of
the form. But, this HGPL has language that allows executable form to be
released of restrictions that otherwise apply. The decompiled code is not
dismissed of those restrictions.

> You are a bully Ron Pinkas. Further proof is found below.

This was a definitive statement right? This was not a question, right?

Here is what MS Word Thesaurus list for Bully:

,--------------------------------------------
| Intimidate, Terrorize, Persecute, Torment,
| Frighten, Oppress, Browbeat, Harass!
`--------------------------------------------

I think most would agree that this kind of name calling is offensive. Maybe
you would have hoped I would now finally become hostile, but I'm still just
amused and curious.

It seems you are not used to being wrong Dave, and not taking this very
well. Your attitude demonstrates, you were probably wrong more times than
you care to admit, but since most [non Bully] people try to avoid
confrontations, you simply scared them away, before they might be able to
Bully you.

In this regard I'm proud to be a Bully Dave. You can trust I'll never
deprive you of your right to be confronted when wrong.

Dave, let's keep it simple, the roots of this argument, is not questions you
asked, but rather false definitive statements you made. Specifically, the
claim the Harbour is covered by a non modified GPL. This is the core of the
argument. Everything else, is secondary. Let's stay focused.

I'm confident, you do have the raw brain energy required to understand why
your claim is false, and you remain argumentative, for what appears to be
defensiveness.

I don't have the discussion in front of me, and yes it was on the list.

IIRC, I offered adding 1 more parameter to the functions in question, which
would be an array populated by the arguments, Victor, explained that
creating multiple versions, to receive 1,2,3 or N parameters for each of the
argument would work better.

1. I though that in your native language a question mark indicates a
question not a statement. Therefore it should be clear that I told the list
nothing of the sort, I rather asked you a question.

2. I did ask the question, because the unanswered question I referred to,
was posted before a subsequent message to which you did reply.

(As I expected) No, because "Yes and No" equals "No".

> Think about the decompilation issue.

All of the files which include the Exception are covered by what I my
attorney referred to as HGPL, which is the GPL + Exception, regardless of
the form. But, this HGPL has language that allows executable form to be
released of restrictions that otherwise apply. The decompiled code is not
dismissed of those restrictions.

> You are a bully Ron Pinkas. Further proof is found below.

This was a definitive statement right? This was not a question, right?

Here is what MS Word Thesaurus list for Bully:

,--------------------------------------------
| Intimidate, Terrorize, Persecute, Torment,
| Frighten, Oppress, Browbeat, Harass!
`--------------------------------------------

I think most would agree that this kind of name calling is offensive. Maybe
you would have hoped I would now finally become hostile, but I'm still just
amused and curious.

It seems you are not used to being wrong Dave, and not taking this very
well. Your attitude demonstrates, you were probably wrong more times than
you care to admit, but since most [non Bully] people try to avoid
confrontations, you simply scared them away, before they might be able to
Bully you.

In this regard I'm proud to be a Bully Dave. You can trust I'll never
deprive you of your right to be confronted when wrong.

Dave, let's keep it simple, the roots of this argument, is not questions you
asked, but rather false definitive statements you made. Specifically, the
claim the Harbour is covered by a non modified GPL. This is the core of the
argument. Everything else, is secondary. Let's stay focused.

I'm confident, you do have the raw brain energy required to understand why
your claim is false, and you remain argumentative, for what appears to be
defensiveness.

I re-verified, and the GPL + Harbour Exception, legally constitutes a new
license, which can't be referred to as the GPL, because it is not!

The exception only wave the restrictions, but nothing else. Legally, this is
a new license.

Which is nonsense, because the Harbour Exception very clearly removes
*one* restriction and *only* one restriction and only under *limited*
circumstances.

I was using the one command line cvs but last year when I installed Win2K it
didnt work anymore.
When I searched Sourforge for a cvs for Win32, I found Wincvs and decided to
try it.
It works for me, the setup is easy.
I must also say that the plain cvs command line is not difficult to use.
The main advantage of wincvs is the "visual click&commit" :-)
It's a matter of if she feels more confortable with command line or GUI
tools.

Which *one*?

Please re-read the Exception:

,------------------------

In legal language == "No Restrictions"!

I can assure you after verifying, and re-verifying, the a US legal expert in
the laws of intellectual properties, insists the above is the only valid

The part that requires that any binary distrubution that uses software
that is covered by the GPL must also be covered by the GPL.

> Please re-read the Exception:

I think I ought to know what the Harbour Exception says. After all, I'm
the one who adapated it from the Guile Exception and typed it into the
doc/hdr_tpl.txt file from which it was later extracted into the
doc/license.txt file by Victor. And I re-read it every time that I paste
it in as a quote. Have you been re-reading it, or just glossing over it?

The only way to reach that conclusion is to take the sentence fragment
"is in no way restricted" out of context. Anybody can make a document
seem to say whatever they want it to say by taking fragments of the
document out of context, but that's not how contracts and licences are
interpreted, as your lawyer should well know. Read the whole thing again:

In other words, it means that just linking in the HRL and/or HVM does
not restrict your use of the executable, but your use of the executable
might still be restricted if your use of it runs afoul of other parts of
the GPL.

But you and your lawyer appear to be reading it as meaning that because
you linked in the HRL and/or HVM, your use of the resulting executable
is exempt from the GPL in its entirety, even though the Harbour
Exception neither states nor implies that.

I challenge you to forward this email, in it's entirety and unedited,
to your lawyer and then post his response, in it's entirety and
unedited, to the list.

Dear Friends

Some time ago their was as thread asking if Harbour would support the New
microsoft .NET. After reading many magazines about Microsoft .NET and Java,
And also doing research on the internet I`ve come to the Follow.

1 ) Microsoft .NET is noting more then an Tool to try to recover the place
that Java from Sun Microsystem Got.

2 ) Apps created by Microsoft .NET will , in my understand, Do the same
thing that Java do today , as accesssing Databases, commercial apps,

3 ) Java is more solid, Have many years of life. I have seen incredible
websites(Home banking) using Java apps to get  what an client has in his
bank account, to recieve payments of docs, and other things, along that
today has many Java programmer as C programmers.

4 ) If we should choice between one of this too, I`ve choose to say with
java. We already has the java output support ready.

Dave,

"MUA's lack of an In-Reply-To header"

It doesn't add one?  Sh*t.  Sorry.  I plan to change it, but that
revolves around BT's promise (now broken!) of ADSL access.

"I thought the concern that Phil was raising is that someone who wants to=

modify parts of the HRTL can't use their modified version in their own
non-free application if they can't get their code accepted by the copyrig=
ht
holder of the file concerned."

I thought that was the issue; I think it's incorrect: i.e. they _can_
use their own changes whether or not they're accepted.  But I think
they _must_ make them available.  (I'm not sure how long for, but at
least as long as they use 'em I'd say.)

"So, I was pointing out (agreeing with you?) that making their changes
available won't allow them to use that code in a non-free application."

Disagreeing, then. :-)  I reckon they can use their own changes (see
above).

I hope.

Er... has your lawyer misread the following (from license.txt):

"Your use of that
 executable is in no way restricted on account of linking the HRL
 and/or HVM code into it."

It is vital to note that there is no comma (,) before "on account".
He appears to be reading it as if that missing comma were present.

It's not, but if it were the "on account" would then mean "because"
- which does seem to be the way he's reading it.

He _does_ have a competent knowledge of English, doesn't he?

An alternative: should the above wording be changed to something
which cannot be misread like that?  Perhaps:

"Your use of that
 executable has no extra restrictions placed on it by the linking of
 HRL and/or HVM code into it."

Or:

"Restrictions, if any, applying to that
 executable are unaffected by the linking of HRL
 and/or HVM code into it."

Next, if it's not the above issue, more info please.

Ok, so which restrictions does it *not* remove, and where does it say so?

I'm confident you are familiar with its content, I read it dozens of times

That was exactly the context I understood, and also the one explained by my
attorney. He did explain and I did forward few times, that the Executable,
is "excused" by the Exception, *only* if its exclusive reliance upon Harbour
Code, is the link inclusion of the compiled HVM, and or the HRL. This is
perfectly clear.

That's the part where you describe an understanding that is not expressed in
the Exception. The Exception, is saying something to the effect of:

</Loose On>
As long as the only Harbour code used by your executable is the compiled
HVM, or HRL, then this Executable is released from all of the GPL
restrictions.
</Loose Off>

Yes it does, it clearly says that if you "only" linked the HVM or HRL, you
are then and only then, free to use this Executable without any
restrictions.

You should read the "this by itself" portion, as if it says "as long as you
didn't link more then just the HVM and/or HRL"!

David, it is clear that you don't trust the input I forwarded to be
objective. I suggest you contact an attorney directly, so that you can
appreciate the input you' receive. I will also forward my phone number on
private email, so that we can discuss it more interactively if you wish.

There is no doubt that is exactly how we all read it. It was always
understood and explained to read something to the effect of: <<as long as
you don't use more than just the compiled HVM and HRL>>.

The "evil" scenario I demonstrated did not use more then just the compiled
HVM and HRL.

This will not change anything, as this was not the problem. The problem is
that one *can* easily use the above to do more then we intended for it to
allow. We wanted to allow a Harbour application to be released without any
GPL restrictions. But the exception doesn't qualify the executable, beyond
the mere link inclusion of the HVM and/or HRL.

As it is now:

If you linked that HVM and/or HRL, and if you didn't use more of Harbour,
than just linking HVM and/or HRL, the resulting executable is free and clear
from all GPL restrictions.

Can you give us more information about his environment and the like? I just
tried this code:

,----[ foo.prg ]
| Function Main()
| 
|    @ 10, 10 to 20, 20
|    inkey( 0 )
|    
| Return( NIL )
`----

and it drew a box with no problems.

What distribution is he using (of both harbour and GNU/Linux)? What version
of that distribution? What version of ncurses? Do other programs that draw
boxes work fine? What sort of terminal is he running this test in?

I as asking if it was on the list at it's current location, this'll tell me

I don't think I understand what "the functions in question" are. Do you mean
the functions that throw the errors (hb_vmPlus(), for example) or do you
mean something else?

But their own changes fall under the GPL don't they? Furthermore, I'm not
sure that a change doesn't cause the harbour exception to be "removed" from
that file. If we can know for sure that the harbour exception *isn't*
"removed" from a file when a derivative work is created then we don't have a
problem at all.

Or, put another way, if the harbour exception isn't removed from the file
when a derivative work is created what is causing them to make their changes
available? If it is removed, what stops that item of code from requiring
that their code be licenced under a GPL compatible licence and that the
executable as a whole be licenced under the GPL?

I'm with Ron and his legal adviser here. I don't think it's quite nonsense.
I'd agree with you that the intention of the harbour exception is to only
remove one "restriction" from the GPL but I can't agree that it *clearly*
removes it.

The exception clearly states that the act of linking with code licenced
under the "harbour licence" doesn't cause the executable as a whole to fall
under the GPL, although that obviously doesn't affect the GPL'd code (be it
under the harbour exception or not). On top of that the exception finishes
off with:

,----
| Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of linking
| the HRL and/or HVM code into it.
`----

which, in the light of what Ron's legal advisor has said, is ambiguous at
best. If anything I'd say the lack of clarity is in "use". The above text
seems to dissolve and not dissolve the GPL, or key parts of it.

It seems to be that the fact of the matter is that if Ron's LA's reading of
the exception is what we've been presented with then we need to think about
making it less ambiguous.

Although making a blanket change to the exception at this late stage might
be difficult at best.

Sure it was a question. The wording of your question tells everyone that
you've already decided that I won't answer your question and that you want
to know why I won't.

Ron, you'd already become hostile. I don't want you to become hostile, quite
the opposite, I want you to start acting like a honest person capable of
having an honest conversation without dismissing people's input as
"baseless!" and "fiction!" and all that other stuff you asked about but
appear to have ignored.

Wrong? I don't have a position to defend here so how on earth can I be
wrong? The only position I'm defending here is that I didn't make a
statement about your legal adviser, I asked a question about what you'd
shown him. You, on the other hand, have used lies to try and weasel around
that.

I just can't believe this. You're presented, twice, with evidence of text
that you and I wrote and you simply ignore it, brush it off, with statements
about people drawing their own conclusions.

It's quite simple, you didn't comprehend the question I was asking (or
perhaps I'd not worded the question well). Instead of acknowledging that
you'd not understood the question or letting me know that the wording had
been misleading you go quoting random text that has nothing to do with the
question I asked and try and use this to show to your readership that
there's some conclusion that needs to be drawn. What's that all about Ron

What, exactly, is unfocused about the questions in those emails I identify

What? I'm asking you to clarify the text you write above and you throw out
more crap?

Look Ron Pinkas, it's really simple. I've not got a position to defend or a
point to "make" so I really don't have to cover up being wrong about
anything. Despite the fantasy you seem to be enjoying and trying to share
with others I really don't have a problem being wrong. Far from it, I like
being wrong, it's called learning.

If it turns out that we have to view harbour's licence as a molested GPL
then that's fine by me, I don't have any stake in an alternative point of
view. All I've done is try and ask for more background on why we'd need to
view it this way, the only answers I've had from your are shouts of
"baseless!" and some stuff about "because I asked by legal advisor". They
are not convincing arguments.

No, I don't have a problem with being wrong. You do seem to have a problem
with people wanting to learn and know more.

What I do have a problem with is bullying, dishonest people who seek to
pollute public spaces with their bullying and dishonesty. Even worse are
bullying, dishonest people who, when presented with the evidence of their
own bullying and dishonesty (even when they ask for that evidence, like you
did), simply ignore it rather than face up to it, acknowledge it, learn from
it and move on.

Also, do you happen to know more-or-less when this conversation took place?
That'd help me pin down which archive I should be looking in.

I think it was on the eGroups list.

--------------------
I just found my message dated Nov-12-2000

We already have hb_errPutArgs(...). It seems very strait forward, to change
hb_errRT_BASE_Subst(...) etc., to receive additional ... arguments and in
turn call hb_errPutArgs(...). Finally it is fairly simple, though time
consuming, to change all hb_err*() calls to include the operands arguments.

I would suggest that hb_errPutArgs() is changed to accept an ARRAY of ITEMs
rather than variable number ITEM parameters. Similarly adding ARRAY of ITEMs
parameter to hb_err*() will make the subsequent call to hb_errPutArgs(...)
much simpler. Generating the ARRAY of operands before calling hb_err*(...)
and passing it to hb_err*() seems quiet simple.

Any comments?

Subject: [Harbour] Bug List
Message-ID: <003601c0a696$f89a2250$921a5e18@bh>

Phil et al:
Here's my buglist.
There are also a few ADS specific bugs that I will take care of so I didn't
incllude them here.

Brian Hays

HARBOUR BUGS
============

GC (Garbage collector) issues
   In a large FiveWin app, hb_gcAll() can cause the app to gpf/disappear

   In reaction to questions on __GetGrip(), Ryszard suggested that a new
   algorithm of managing allocated/deallocated lists of items would be
   better.

   If this is necessary to stabilize memory I would keep it at
   the top of the list!

------------------------------------------------------------------
Symbol searches fail if the symbol has trailing spaces.
   For example,
      use test alias test
      // this would be cVar's value if read from a dbf field
      cVar := "TEST      "
      select(cVar)  --> returns 0
   The discussion on this centered on a desire to not slow down all symbol
   handling (the bug is not only in the select function)


----------------------
Array corruption (GC?)
   Arrays can become nil in a large app after being passed by reference
   and/or not by reference, including as a detached local reference in a
   codeblock.  This has not been reproducible in a test applet.

----------------------
Macro handling of str lengths for numbers
   FUNCTION test ()
      local cVar := "'x'+str(12345678901)+'x'"
      ? 'x'+str(12345678901)+'x'
      ? &cVar
   RETURN Nil
Harbour output has a space for both:
   x 12345678901x
   x 12345678901x

   Clipper does not if it's macro compiled.
   x12345678901x
   x 12345678901x
----------------------

ordKeyVal and others are still in dummy.prg
   I was waiting on implementing those until a decision was made on
   Ryszard's proposed RDD changes.
   Should they go into dbcmd.c ?

----------------------
ord.ch should be coordinated with a new dbInfo.ch
   What are the legal issues of header files looking an awful lot
   like those of another development system?

----------------------
COPY TO is incomplete



Reported by others
----------------------
>From Alejandro Mery Pellegrini <amery@ing.puc.cl>
THE 'SAVE TO' statement doesn't work like clipper's.
   i.e.
   like nom?? works for nom10, but not for nom1

Ron,

"The "evil" scenario I demonstrated did not use more then just the compil=
ed
HVM and HRL."

You mean the "evil" linker?  I don't see why it's "evil".  I'm sorry,
I'm obviously missing something.  If I use XXX's linker to build my
Harbour-using EXE, what does it matter whether XXX is Borland, MS,
or this "evil" person?

I might agree that it is a dual license, not a modified GPL. You 
have a choice which one you use.

It was a failure in something running Python.

Patrick needs to include the search interface on the website. The 
backside is done.

Quoting from the Harbour Exception, "this does not by itself cause the

Oh, yes it did! Your "evil" scenario not only had the HRL and HVM
linked into the linker program for its use in executing its functions,
but it also had the HRL and HVM bound to it for the purpose of linking
those two libraries to another program. Only the first use is covered by
the Harbour Exception. The second use is a binary distribution of the
libraries themselves, which is *not* covered by the binary distribution.

So I noticed! ;-))
I have configured the Harbour-Project.org domain so that my server acts like
a back-up server.
The 3th and 4th DNS setting is the Bekz.net server.

This way, when TAZZ refuses, I can take over for a moment. (Only WEB, not
FTP and LIST)

That's an interesting way of looking at it. The obvious question is that if
it's a *dual* licence what are the two licences that you get to choose from?
On the one hand you've got the GPL, anyone electing to use harbour to
develop free software gets to choose a GPL compatible free software licence
and they must distribute the package as a whole under the GPL.

On the other hand there's a "licence" that you need to observe if you're
writing non-free software. What Ron and his legal advisor seem to be saying
is that although the GPL hasn't been modified in any "real world" sense it
is modified in a legal sense and so this is, legally (in the US at least),
presented as a licence in it's own right which is either a modified GPL or
is, at least, based on the GPL (or something, I'm still a bit confused about
what the real case is here).

So, what is the licence on the "other hand"?

Odd, I tried a couple of "obviously narrow" searches and managed to come up
with articles that didn't seem to include the keywords I searched for.
Trying a mailing list search for "hagbard" for example.

Dave,

"But their own changes fall under the GPL don't they?"

Right (which is why they have to make them available).

"I'm not sure that a change doesn't cause the harbour exception to
be "removed" from that file."

It's not removed.  Making a change to source code can't alter a
license.  You'd need the license holder's consent to do that.

"If we can know for sure that the harbour
exception *isn't* "removed" from a file when a derivative work is
created then we don't have a problem at all."

Then we don't have a problem. :-)

"if the harbour exception isn't removed from the file when a
derivative work is created what is causing them to make their changes
available?"

Unless the derivative work is an executable, the GPL applies - thus
they have to make their changes available.

"If it is removed, what stops that item of code from requiring that
their code be licenced under a GPL compatible licence and that the
executable as a whole be licenced under the GPL?"

It's not removed. :-)

John.

One of the possible reasons could be that he uses a screen font 
prepared for Russian language in which case chars between 128 
and 255 can be whatever they are. 
This was for example true for me when I used badly formed fonts
for polish ISO-8859-2 code page.
Ask him to check if he uses standard 437 code page.

How would you reply to such ridicules accusation thrown your way? I am
fairly confident your recent attempts to shift focus away from your
statement (that I labeled as baseless), qualifies.

This argument started with you making certain claims about the Harbour
License which I then labeled as false and baseless.

I did my best trying to address all *sub-sequent* questions.

How can you claim you don't want me to become hostile, and at the same
sentence accuse me of being dishonest? How would an honest person, address
what he himself, and a legal expert consider false and baseless? Why do you
think that considering your opinion, false and/or baseless, makes one
dishonest? Why do you think you have the exclusive right to evaluate the
basis of your publicly stated opinions?

Absolutely false! You stated that Harbour License is not a modified GPL
license, I called it baseless. We have been arguing this ever since. You
have repeated this false claim, in practically every one of your messages
throughout this exchange. How can you honestly claim, you don't have a
position to defend? Have you changed your opinion about the basis/validity
of your claim? If you did, when did you advise of this change of hart? If
you didn't aren't you defending your position?

No Dave, those who read this exchange know what the argument is about, they
do know, what I called false and baseless. I doubt that any of the readers
know, what this "evidence of text" is all about.

I believe I answered each and every one of your questions, if I missed any,
please quote and I'll attempt to answer if I can. Regardless, the lack of
focus, is in directing attention away from the argued issues, which are:

**********
1. Is the Harbour License a modified version of the GPL, yes or no?

2. Did I overstep my boundaries by describing your claim that the <<Harbour
License is *not* a modified version of the GPL>> false and baseless, or was
my response justified?
**********

I have nothing else to argue here. I ask that we focus back our attention to
the above 2 issues. This is far more productive for Harbour, then my
Bullying, and Dishonest qualities.

Please let us know if you withdraw your claim that the Harbour License is
not a modified GPL. If you didn't, please don't tell us you have no position
to defend.

It's not about stakes, it is about a statement with legal context being
either legally correct, or false, and baseless. Are you still backing your
original claim? *If* you are no longer sure, why would you take offense to
my description of it as being false and baseless? If you still stand behind
your statement why would claim you have no position to defend?

Please explain, this Bully theory? What means of
intimidation/persecution/torment/frightning/opression/harrasment did I apply
against poor Dave?

Dishonesty, is much more serious, and far worse accusation! I though we new
how to respect and even enjoy our arguments. Referring to me as "dishonest
people" is beyond the scope of such argument. I hope you will sometime soon
"learn" (like claim you like to), that context is very important to the
tone, and scope of an argument. Individuals like us should be able to argue
without getting so personal, and without resorting to generic unqualified
statements. There is a huge difference between saying, I find your argument
dishonest, to saying you are a dishonest person.

Should that last part read "which is *not* covered by the harbour

If it's not releasing all restrictions, I can't see where does it list what
will/won't apply.

Why would you argue this, instead of contacting a copyright expert you can
trust, and find out the true legal meaning of this exception?

Every executable is a binary distribution!

Our Exception specifically release all restrictions that otherwise apply, if
the executable in question "only" include compiled versions of the HVM
and/or HRL.

You never explained how did my "evil" executable, did more than "linking the
HRL and/or HVM code into it"?

Since "this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered
by the GNU General Public License" what did?

David, please remember, that it is not my opinion, or yours, that matter,
but rather what can be successfully argued in court of law.

Not so!

1. The Exception does not mention any choice (other then the effective
Version No. of the GPL).
2. Even if it did, this new multiple choice agreement, would have been
legally considered a new modified License.

Just exactly which part of "this does not by itself cause the resulting
executable to be covered by the [GPL]" is it that is so difficult for
you to understand? The *only* clause that is potentially being released
is the *one* clause that is *explicitly* listed!

The only thing a "copyright expert" can do is give an *opinion* on what
he or she *thinks* the "true legal meaning" is. And if you ask five
"experts", you're likely to get five different opinions. There can be no
"true legal meaning" until a judge or jury has handed down a verdict in
a specific case involving this particular license in a particular
jurisdiction. And even then, the "true legal meaning" may only apply to
that particular jurisdiction. Or haven't you noticed the contradictory
rulings handed down by different Federal district courts in nearly
identical copyright infringment cases in the US?

What you apparently missed, is that this is no "regular" linker. It links
Harbour *compatible* pcode with *the* Harbour HVM and HRL to produce Harbour
*like* executable, but not being subject to Harbour License, and without
having to give Harbour any credit (even though some 2/3 of this is actually
Harbour).

I think I can do that if nobody else volunteers.  How big is the

Which is?

What is indeed difficult to understand, is why would you argue against clear
legal advice of a competent legal expert? Since you don't trust, that I did
forward your input, and it didn't change my attorney's opinion, why don't
you seek the advice of a qualified expert you do trust?

You don't expect us to rely on your opinion against that of a legal expert,
do you?

This is indeed correct, but relying on such opinion, is far safer than
relying on our unqualified opinions, wouldn't you agree?

While nothing is certain, in term of legal outcome, one should rely on
professional advice so as to steer clear of obvious problems, and
ambiguities. That in itself will not guarantee one the desired result, but
will improve one's chances.

And I've tried really hard to show you that my claim wasn't baseless, I've
tried really hard to show you that my "claim" had a basis in fact. In case
you're missing where all of this is leading: I can see that, in the very
near future, either the FAQ will need expanding regarding licence issues or
a licence-helper document might need to be written. Seeing as how I'm
probably the prime candidate for doing this work I want to fully understand
what your legal advisor is saying. So, on more than one occasion I've
documented my confusion and the *basis* for what I said so that you had
everything necessary to document where I was wrong.

Instead you simply keep writing that I can't cope with being wrong. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Why would I seek to document my confusion
otherwise?

Perhaps you'd care to go back to the initial statement that you labeled as
"baseless" and, keeping in mind that it isn't baseless, that there is a
basis for me saying what I did, politely and honestly document where I'm
wrong? Perhaps you'd also care to do so without attempting to invent a
position for me?

Could you do that for me and could you do that for harbour?

> Every executable is a binary distribution!

And the Harbour Exeption *only* applies to a binary distribution that
has linked the HRL and/or HVM into it for the purpose of being executed,
not to one that has them bound to it for the purpose of distributing the
library.

No, it does not, as I have clearly explained over and over again.

I guess you *missed* reading the part of my message that explains that,
*despite* your having quoted it in your reply!

> Since "this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered
> by the GNU General Public License" what did?

OK, one more time, but with more technical details: When a library is
linked into an executable, you lose all the "library" aspects of the
original library. In order for the linker to link the HRL and/or HVM
into another program, it has to have the HRL and/or HVM in library
format. Which means that it can't use the HRL and/or HVM that were
linked into the linker program itself, because that copy of the HRL
and/or HVM is missing the library information. Which means that in order
to not include the HRL and/or HVM as separate library files with the
binary distribution of the linker, they have to be bound to the linker
in library format, such as by simply appending them to the end of the
original binary of the linker executable. It is *this* use of the HRL
and/or HVM that causes the GPL to apply to this linker, overriding the
*potential* application of the Harbour Exception for the *other* use of
the HRL and/or HVM.

Except when the provider of such an opinion has obviously misread the

  Well, there is a little to report except that I am working on it.

  I think that a working code will be available at the end of April.
In the meantime I will try to add support for getGrip/dropGrip that will

It's right there in the part that you quoted, so why do you keep acting
as if it isn't there? It's the part that reads "...cause the resulting
executable to be covered by the GNU Public License."

If the HRL and/or HVM did not use the Harbour Exception, then a binary
distribution of the resulting executable would have to be released under
the GPL (or a compatible license). But because the HRL and/or HVM do
have the Harbour Exception, then the resulting executable might not have
to be released under the GPL, if the only thing that was done with the
HRL and/or HVM was to link them into the executable (i.e., include them
for the purpose of executing them).

And that is the *only* clause of the GPL that Harbour code has the
*potential* to be exempted from.

  I think the the choise is simple: we will have to add either a code to 
create an array of arguments in all places where errors are generated or 
call hb_errPutArgs() with these arguments. The first solution will 
produce bigger executables and will be much more error prone since 
building an array is not a single function call. We can create some macro 
for it but we have hb_errPutArgs() function for this purpose already.

It is not very wise to assume, that an expert has "obviously misread"
anything, on account that you don't agree with the opinion of such expert!

1. Our exception does *not* qualify what is "bound" as opposed to link.

2. I'm not a linker expert, but, I can't agree that linking will necessarily
"lose the library aspects". As an example, most of us already agreed that a
DLL is considered an executable, didn't we? Is there anything stopping our
"evil" from distributing the HVM and HRL in DLL form, to serve its Harbour
compatible pcode?

Except that in this case, it is. Your expert appears to be reading the
Harbour Exception as if there were a comma present in it at one point,
where there clearly is no comma, and by taking an out of context
fragment to be the the overriding scope of the Harbour Exception, which
it clearly isn't.

This is only your assumption, which BTW is wrong. My attorney reaffirmed

It says "...if you link..." and to link means to include for purpose of
execution.

If the linker only contains the unmodified HRL and HVM for the linker
to execute, then it would in all likelyhood not have to be distributed
under the GPL. If distributing just the the HVM and HRL in library form
is even allowed under the GPL, then the libraries would probably have to
be distributed under the GPL *without* the Harbour Exception, which I
expect would mean that using the non-GPL linker together with the GPL
library would cause any resulting executable to have to be placed under
the GPL (or compatible license).

But would it still be the case if someone were to download the non-GPL
linker and also download the same version of Harbour that was used in
the creation of the linker, and use the HRL and HVM from the Harbour
distribution with the linker to create a new executable? Well, I for one
don't really care, because at that point, it is obvious that the linker
and Harbour are separate products and what we are mainly trying to
prevent is someone from passing off Harbour as their own work.

Or, to put it another way, it (the exception) speaks to binary data that is
linked to the file in such a way that it is callable and executable from
other code, not linked such that it is simply some cargo or a non-executable
resource. Right?

That's the intent, but it's looking like we may have to reword the
exception to ensure that the intent doesn't get lost when the exception
is read by someone with a legalistic mind-set.

Hi, gang.

May I suggest we delegate someone to contact FSF for a referral to an
attorney who can help us with these questions?

It's possible that we could even do this without cost, if said attorney
is particularly friendly to the Free Software movement.

I don't doubt the competence of the lawyer Ron contacted, but the GPL
is an oddity even in the realm of intellectual property law, and we are
unavoidably (not Ron's fault) getting a "filtered" version of what this
lawyer heard and said.

It's an important discussion, but it doesn't have to be a big controversy.

Aren't we all on the same side?

David, what about the HVM + HRL in DLL form? Didn't we intend to allow it
(in the context of running an Harbour application)?

Don't you see that if we don't qualify it, anyone can distribute DLL form of
HVM and/or HRL without subjecting such, to GPL terms? He won't even have to
"credit" Harbour at all. If he managed to create Harbour compatible pcode
compiler, he now has complete Harbour like package (2/3 of which is actually
Harbour), and none of this is subject to any GPL terms, if he so chooses.

Agreed, you obviously need the copyright holder's consent to modify a
licence. The ambiguity I'm concerned about is that it could be seen that the
exception isn't "transferable" when a derived work is made. If what Ron's
legal advisor says is true for all "reasonable" countries then the point is
moot anyway. This is why I'm actually very interested in what Ron's legal
advisor has might have said, if it does turn out that we can and have to
view what we've got here as a licence that doesn't change when a derived
work is made it means we don't actually have a problem with ERRORSYS and
friends either (as, if you're reading this David, you suspected bet we were
both worried about any possible ambiguity).

It would begin to appear so. This is good news.

Ahh, hmm, now I see an ambiguity. Or perhaps not. This is another reason for
me wanting to be totally sure about what Ron's legal advisor has said and
wondering how applicable it is in general, if we only have once licence, not
a "choice", then the GPL wouldn't appear to be "there".

That is, I can see how we'd like this to work and I can see how most people
would intend it to work, I'm just concerned that the implications of what
Ron's LA has said might work for us one way but against us another.

Those type checks attempted to check the type of a variable that didn't
exist (a typo of oError), so the recursive error call problem still existed
but for a different reason.

Attached is a patch to fix this.

If you say so. What I saw was an attempt to limit uses that are valid
under the GPL. I don't see any reason for Harbour to be more restrictive
than the GPL.

Yes, but it may still be subject to GPL.  Your example linker is,
because it includes the LIBs in a form where they do _not_ qualify
for the Harbour Exception.

It does _not_ release all restrictions in the way you say.

It also includes the HRL/HVM code in a LIB (or equivalent) form, in
what is a blatant attempt to bypass the license.  Courts can deal
with such abuses.

Including those LIBs.

Yes, it so links, but I believe that doesn't have the effect you/your
lawyer claimed.  As others have said, you're linking some extra stuff
in what is clearly an attempt to get around the license.  That's just
an abuse, something courts are generally quite good at dealing with.

I think that passing an array of items needs a relatively complex
preparation, 
and cosidering the large number of hb_err() calls, the fact that
this
call is 
not part of the actual functionality of the caller, and that my main
goal till 
now was to make the error launching call a one-liner, which is as
simple 
as possible and which doesn't require any stack space from the 
caller
side. 
Because of these I think that the array approach doesn't fit here.

My implementation would include a hb_err() functionl which would 
accept two arguments (which is one of the most common), one 
which 
would accept one (which is the other most common), perhaps one 
which would accept three (should check if it's worth), and finally
one
with a variable number of parameters, for the rest of the cases.

As a small statistic here are the current hb_err() calls with :arg:
1 parameter: 83
2 parameter: 154
3 parameter: 16
4 parameter: 2
Total of: 255 (83+154+16+2)

Two more notes:
1) Only BASE error types need the :arg feature currently.
2) For easy calling, the caller should pass the original ITEM
pointer
to the hb_err() function (not a copy of the ITEM)

Message-ID: <60026F9F4AE1D41180E600508B550E2917841C@postal.extendsys.com>

After yesterdays announcement we have had a number of phone calls. To help
answer some of the questions we posted the follow message on our news group.
I thought that everyone on the Harbour Team should be aware of this as well.
I hope this will answer everyone's questions.  If you would like more
information please feel free to contact me and I will be happy to help you.

We are pleased to announce to Advantage Partners/users yesterday's
definitive agreement by Palm to acquire Extended Systems.  This is great
news for both Advantage and its business partners, who will benefit from
Palm's keen interest in application developers.  As Extended Systems'
President and CEO Steve Simpson said, "Together, we significantly strengthen
our ability to serve the needs of the explosive enterprise market.   It's a
win-win for customers, employees and stockholders."  Extended Systems will
become part of Palm's Enterprise business unit, which will be based in
Boise, Idaho and headed by Steve Simpson.

For the Advantage Team, it's business as usual.  Our partner relationships
will remain in effect and we will continue to develop and market Advantage
Database Server with a broadened set of resources and partners. We hope to
leverage this fast-growing and profitable software business opportunity and
we're very enthusiastic about our shared vision and prospects with Palm.

Not only are our companies' products highly complementary, but our cultures
are as well.  We share an intense customer focus.  We both emphasize speed
to market, agility, and teamwork to keep pace with customer needs and stay
ahead of the curve.

As an Advantage Partner, you will continue to hear a lot more from us about
the exciting prospects for the business in the next few months.  As always,
you will continue to receive regular updates from us on new developments
with Advantage.  We remain dedicated to providing the quality products,
customer service, and support that you have come to expect from Extended
Systems.

contact your Advantage Sales Representative.

We look forward to continuing to serve your data management needs and
appreciate your ongoing support and feedback.

1. Expert, does not need to be in quotes, he is an experienced attorney
specializing in intellectual properties, thus expert in this context.

2. Assuming he "obviously misread" is unwise, regardless of the number of
the unqualified individuals disagreeing with his opinion.

I never stated the LIBs linked to my example linker, are in any specific
form.

Which is the exact opposite of the Exception text.

I never said I link anything extra, I said the exact opposite. Take instead
the DLL scenario, as it is less ambiguous. We do allow the HVM and HRL to be
linked by means of a DLL. This DLL is still excused by the Exception, right?
Do you not see how this DLL might be used just like my linker in the "evil"
scenario?

David, I've put the harbour license in those files, I hope they'll do it.

I am still with harbour but I have don't have much free time by now.
I am working on new sorting routines for the cdx rdd in order to manage
large files, I did not say nothing because I can spend little time on it, so
I cant make any promises.

So, where does that leave us regarding our current code base and 
licencing statements?

You identified 6 last week. Are they all updated?

It is 300-400 these days and is totally opt-in. And easily and well 
marked for optout without human intervention.

I think I have read enough copyright background on software to 
make a relatively well educated statement, and I don't have time or 
money to persue what would no doubt be expensive legal copyright 
expertise.

Anything that is not GPL does not necessarily meand it's a 
modified GPL.

But it's something. A second license where you can ignore the 
GPL for specific instances if you so wish.

The fact is that you are not required to use the exception unless 
you choose to do so, so the real GPL is in force and unmodified if 
you so choose.

That's why I think we should be thinking towards a dual license 
situation.

1. The result of Harbour compiler output in executable form is GPL 
if you wish.

2. The result if Harbour compiler in executable form is not GPL if 
you wish ... if and only if certain rules are followed.

To me, that is not a modified GPL, it's a choice between a very 
restrictive license (GPL) and a very non restrictive license (Harbour 
License) that has no bearing on the first choice and does nothing 
to negate that choice.

The 'Harbour Exception' license, which states that under certain 
specific circumstances, you can elect to not inherit the GPL.

Well, the long hand name for a DLL is Dynamically Linked 
LIBRARY, so I can't see how it would be considered an 
executable. It has no bootstrap.

Hi Ryszard.

Just wanted to drop a note to thank you for all the work you have 
done, (a truly deep contribution) and for the work you continue on. 
We'll be grateful for all code you contribute with great thanks for 
any time you have to contribute.

You do what you've got to do. We all have our priorities.

No, it would just be a copy of the email addresses that are in the 
main list [Harbour] distribution.

This would allow someone to do a BCC to the list I put out to say 
something like.

Phil's machine is down for repair, expected up time is...

So people wouldn't wonder why there was no traffic.

Regardless of the number of choices one is given, any software is only
covered by one License. The compounded sum of all the terms is referred to
as the Software License.

There is no wording in the Exception that describes such a choice.

We don't have to do this. Any one can distribute what ever software he owns
as GPL. If one is not "forced" to use GPL, he has the right to do so,
without us having to say so.

Right, we "just" need to define those rules...

The sum of (global/whole/composite) Harbour License is *not* the GPL. My
attorney referred to it as a "modified GPL", because it is based on the GPL
but it is not *the* GPL. He actually called "amended GPL".

Ryszard, Dave,

After re-reading Victor's input and Ryszard's input, it seems we can take
advantage of all the input as follows:

1. Create a new hb_MakeArray() based on hb_errPutArgs() as follows:

//-------------------------------------------------------------//
PHB_ITEM hb_MakeArray( USHORT uiArgCount, ... )
{
   PHB_ITEM pArray;
   USHORT uiArgPos;
   va_list va;

   HB_TRACE(HB_TR_DEBUG, ("hb_MakeArray(%hu, ...)", uiArgCount));

   pArray = hb_itemArrayNew( uiArgCount );

   /* Build the array from the passed arguments. */

   va_start( va, uiArgCount );
   for( uiArgPos = 1; uiArgPos <= uiArgCount; uiArgPos++ )
      hb_itemArrayPut( pArray, uiArgPos, va_arg( va, PHB_ITEM ) );
   va_end( va );

   return pArray;
}
//-------------------------------------------------------------//

2. Change hb_errRT_BASE() to accept 5th PHB_ITEM parameter, so that we call
it as follows:

  hb_errRT_BASE( EG_STROVERFLOW, 1209, NULL, "+", hb_MakeArray( 2, pItem1,
pItem2 ) );

3. hb_errRTBASE() will also be modified to forward the array to
hb_errRT_New(), and later release the Array Item.

This should address all concerns, regarding ease of use, size,
susceptibility to errors, caller stack requirements, and it is still a one
liner. Best of all we don't have to create multiple versions of
hb_errRT_BASE() and hb_errRT_New().

1. I have some recollection of us referring to DLLs as executable (we
wouldn't be the first).
2. I have some recollection of us talking about allowing the HVM + HRL as a
DLL.
3. If we didn't allow it at all (non GPL), wouldn't it be too harsh a
restriction?

What .DLL's do isn't up to us to decide.

A library is a block of objects ready for a linker to include when 
referenced.

A DLL is a block of objects ready for dynamic linking at runtime.

What has this got to do with the Harbour Exception except 
_when_?

We don't have a 'when clause', do we?

BTW, our exception reads "if you link" not "if you [static] link", it read
"on account of linking" not "on account of static linking". I believe it's
fait to say that Dynamic Linking an executable is still nothing more than
linking, and that a DLL in this configuration is an integral part of this
executable.

I don't know for sure.  The license doesn't define executable.  A DLL
is not in some senses an executable, yet in other senses it is.  But
it's mainly a Library (the final L in DLL).  I believe people here
intended to allow a DLL, in which case the "evil" linker _may_ be
allowed.  I think it's not, because of this:

In the case where HVM/HRL is/are in a DLL, the executable is _not_
the DLL, it is instead the combination of the non-DLL _and_ the DLL.

The "evil" linker would be performing actions (joining Harbour
compiler output to the DLL) to create an executable, and those actions
are (as before with a LIB) clearly being done in an attempt to bypass
the license, and so it's still an abuse with which a court should be
able to deal.

After a vast number of messages from many people you say that!  Well,
if it was factually accurate that would be bad because it would mean
so many people have wasted their time, but fortunately I don't see it
as being accurate.  At least, it's as true about us as it is about
your lawyer.  In a sense it could be said that all that would matter
would be a court's (possibly appealed, re-appealed etc) decision.  And
even then no doubt any specific action would have specific details so
that it might take many cases, in each of many jurisdictions, before
we really know.  Until then, your comment above strikes me as
pointless.

The exact form doesn't matter.  Especially to a court, where the

So?  That's what I said: the "evil" linker is an obvious abuse.  A
court could deal with that.  _We_ could deal with it in NGs etc by
exposing the "evil" person.  We probably could _not_ afford the court
case, however. :-(

They're not that easy to find, not cheap, and (judging by yours) not

In that case, why not use the simpler:

And have hb_errRT_BASE() deal with the uiArgCount.

He appears to have misread (inserting a comma that isn't there).  You
say he says he hasn't so misread, but have not provided any details
of how the license can be construed the way he says.  So, at the
moment he looks wrong.  I'm open to persuasion if you'll post his
explanation of how he can interpret that sentence the way he does,
bearing in mind that the comma concerned is absent.

If his explanation is along the lines of the comma not needing to be
there from a legal POV (for whatever reason), please at the same time
ask him how to change that sentence to mean what it means in English
(which is where the comma would make a vital difference).

The intent of the Harbour Exception to allow both static and dynamic
linking, which is why the type of linking is not specified.

Yes he specializes in software copyright. He negotiated my Software License

John, please excuse me for saying so, but I really don't think you are
qualified to evaluate the correctness of his legal ability. I said numerous
times already, that he never considered a comma, that *you* think needs to
be there for him to be right.

Please clarify what specific portion of his description you don't agree
with, and I'll try to get a clarification.

No, because regardless of how the "evil linker" and the HRL/HVM
libraries are distributed, either the linker or the HRL/HVM libraries
will have to be distributed under the GPL (or a compatible license),
because even if the HRL/HVM is distributed only as a single set of DLLs,
which both the "evil linker" and the programs that it links will use,
the DLLs are serving a dual purpose, one of which is a binary
distribution, so the Harbour Exception would not apply to the DLLs and
they would have to be distributed under the GPL (o.a.c.l.). So if the
linker and the DLLs were distributed together, then the linker would
also have to be distributed under the GPL (o.a.c.l.). I'm not sure if
the GPL would allow those DLLs to be released as a standalone
distribution, so if the author of the "evil linker" doesn't want to
release the linker under the GPL (o.a.c.l.), he will probably have to
make available a binary distribution of Harbour that contains the DLLs,
so there would be no doubt as to what free software the "evil linker"
author is legally using.

I can't see how you arrive at this, and my attorney specifically explained,
that if we don't qualify "if you link" and "on account of linking" then it
is simply left open.

The exception specifically allows (non GPL) distribution of the HVM and HRL,
*if* this distribution is in the form of "linking it with other files to
produce an executable". My scenario falls neatly under this allowance.

This double purpose you talk about has no support, in the Exception. My
"Evil" did *no* *more* then "linking it with other files to produce an
executable". Our Exception does *not* say how many purposes such link is
allowed to have.

But it *is* qualified, by the fragment that reads, "this does not by
itself", which means that other factors could restrict the resulting
executable.

And the sentence that reads "Your use of that executable is in no way
restricted on account of linking the HRL and/or HVM code into it," does
not mean that if you link the HRL and/or HVM code into your executable,
your executable is not restricted by any terms of the GPL. What it
actually means is that linking the HRL and/or HVM code into your
executable does not invoke the GPL restrictions on what you can do with
the executable.

Seeing as how your attorney has misread the Harbour Exception, it is
quite likely that some other attorneys will also misread it. This means
that we need to reword the Harbour Exception. Not in order to change
what it means, but to try to reduce the possibility that folks with a
legalistic mind-set will read into it things that it most definitely
does not say.

As it turns out, the Harbour Exception consist of only a small

just today obtained a full copy of the Guile License, which I
have adapted to refer to Harbour and the Harbour Project and

 This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why

I don't see the explanation I asked for. :-(

Let's get this straight.  For normal English that comma matters.  I do
hope neither you nor he disagrees.  That leads on to what I wrote
before, i.e. asking how it can be read that way from a legal POV and
how to fix it (see below).

You've just repeated it!  Also, that a DLL is not in itself an
executable.

I don't _really_ want a "clarification".  I want the license fixing if
it's broken. :-)

What it says.  It's not complex; what did you not understand in it,
especially bearing in mind I've explained this more than once and you
appeared to understand it.

I see no point in carrying on the way we are.  The whole process is
a bit like the Harbour team made a PRG which works for all of them,
then someone (you) took it to an expert in another Xbase dialect (your
lawyer).  He compiled it with his Xbase dialect but it goes wrong in
some way.  He doesn't say exactly what and we can only find out hints
(at best) through you.  He may or may not have a fix but has not said.
Frankly it's no way to diagnose a bug let alone fix it.

I've explained that a DLL is not an executable.  I've explained the
English meaning of the license in the absence of that comma.  I've
asked how it is that it can be read to mean something else.  I've
asked for a rewording of the license by your lawyer so it means what
we meant (and what I read it to mean already - using English, but we
need legalese).  Now it's time your lawyer addressed these issues so
that we get the license we thought we had.

Failing that, I see no way forward and we should drop the thread.  If
we do that, at worst it appears the license is too free; let's try to
live with it.  Better to be too open than too closed.

John.

Sorry, no one asked what he specializes in (before you did). I assumed that
was clear from the fact that he was my attorney and deals with IP. I
wouldn't have seek his advise if that was not his field.

John, the problem you find with his interpretation is not related to the use
of a comma.

I really am not sure why you think that reading the Exception "in English"
should yield different understanding. Let me try and go over the paragraph
and explain his input one final time:

 * The exception is that if you link the Harbour Runtime Library (HRL)
 * and/or the Harbour Virtual Machine (HVM) with other files to produce
 * an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable
 * to be covered by the GNU General Public License. Your use of that
 * executable is in no way restricted on account of linking the HRL
 * and/or HVM code into it.

The first sentence "if you link ... this doesn't by itself ...", reads in
English:

,----------------------------------------------
| as long as your executable does not borrow
| more than the specified excluded components,
| it is not covered by the GPL.
`----------------------------------------------

The 2nd, sentence, "Your use ... is in mo way restricted on account of ..."
reads in English:

,----------------------------------------------
| if your executable does not borrow any other
| code outside of the excluded components, then
| your use of the executable is not restricted
| in any way.
`----------------------------------------------

Do you claim that these "interpretations" are not consistent with the
English Language?

Dynamic Linking is a form of linking, and the linked DLL becomes integral
part of the executable by means of the link. Obviously the executable is not
complete without the linked DLL.

> I don't _really_ want a "clarification".  I want the license fixing if

It depends on our definition for broken. I believe that the Exception,
should make it clear that we allow the HVM and/or HRL to be excluded
(excused from forcing GPL), *only* if the executable is indeed an Harbour
application. This can easily be fixed.

I hope it's now clear the problem has nothing to do with the comma. The
problem is with the lack of any qualification on what "deserves" to be
linked with the HVM and/or HRL and still be excused from the GPL.

Sorry for upsetting you. If you don't agree with the above interpretation,
we might still be at the exact same point, and I could ask you the exact

Yes. 

Did you get mine re removing the DNS entries temporarily to see if 
that is what is creating the problem?

I'm not having any problem, but I mail to the machine with the 
primary DNS records, so it's extremely doubtful that I would ever 
resolve anywhere else.

No, I did not get your mail...
But I removed the Bekz.net DNS settings from the Harbour-Project.org domain.
It was only there for 2 days. I had put it in when TAZ2 had problems some
days ago.

I don't agree, but I think maybe it turns on the word "link".  I think
the H.proj. meant it in the sense of what a linker does.  Unfortunately
it can have the wider English meaning.

Using the intended meaning (bear with me) I think your re-write is
incorrect.  If so, (part of) the fix is (*) to make clear what "link"
meaning is intended.

(*) may be; see what others here say and what your lawyer says

IAC, strictly your version and the original are different (because
yours only covers a subset) but I'm pretty sure that difference is
not your point and is just an outcome of "translating" the word "link".

Strictly, as before, it doesn't mean that.  That diff. matters but
let's work on "link"/"linking".

I'm not sure it can.  The "evil" linker looks like a Harbour app.

If you (& your lawyer <g>) say not, fine.

Given my comments above, I don't see any such problem.  We probably
have to define what "link" means, that's all.

I'm not upset - sorry if it seems so.  "Frustrated" would be a better
word - due to slow (almost no!) progress despite the flood of messages.

Er... even so, I hope we could be "upset" from time to time but not
bear any grudges. :-)  You know: fall out 3 times a day but not on a
permanent basis. :-) :-)

> If you don't agree with the above interpretation

Basically I don't, but I think the "link" issue is the main one.

In view of people's differing shades of meanng about DLLs / shared
libs (and there are prob. other names, too) it might be useful to
clarify that such a thing is not by itself an executable.  And perhaps
(probably?) also in what context an HVM/HRL lib can be used (which is
probably only with a Harbour compiler-derived executable).

Well... as I have been stating since I wrote APPEND FROM/COPY TO, the latter
is NOT creating the output file. This is because I think we need an RDDNode
level function to check file existance. UNLESS COPY TO should just go out
and create the table, even if it exists..., but then we neen a DropTable
which is not available. All this takes me back to my proposal (which has
never been commented) on adding to the RDDNode level three "virtual"
functions (that each RDD shoul provide), namely : CreateTable, DropTable &
TableExists.
With this functionality everythisng should work fine on enviroments where
tables are abstract entities and not files. I also commented that the
current implementation of dbCreate() (and Clipper's) is a hack on dbOpen()
and not an independent functionality.

Anybody has something to say?

I don't understand, what is the intended meaning in your opinion? Can you
please provide a small interpretation like I did? I have no clue how it can
be interpreted to say anything other than what it clearly does.

What meaning of link my interpretation was using, that is different than
what link is? My Interpretation could easily read:

,--------------------------------------------
| as long as your executable does not link in
| more than the specified excluded components,
| it is not covered by the GPL.
`--------------------------------------------

Now that the word link is not interpreted, does it change my interpretation?
What would be wrong with the above interpretation? Actually I used borrow
because it has wider scope than link. My attorney used the term "rely". He
said as long as the Executable, doesn't rely on other Harbour code.

John, please believe me I have no clue what difference you are talking
about. If I describe only a subset, it means I dropped something, what did I
drop?

I don't understand how can you read "on account of", or "this doesn't by
itself", to mean anything other then, "more is needed (to violate) - this
much is allowed"!!! If you agree with this, than what is "more" in this
context, of what *is* allowed?

No it isn't, Harbour Application involves the HVM executing pcode, compiled
by the Harbour compiler.

Do you still think we are reading some non existing comma?

Airing all these issues is still a progress, and I'm confident we'll soon
find some common understanding.

Normally lack of response to a posted proposal, means there are no
objections. I don't recall if there were no responses, if that was the case,
you could proceed, by implementing your proposal.

Ron,
        the problem is that my proposal means changing every RDD
implementation, which I'm not sure I can do. What could be an alternative
path? Maybe "publish" the core change and one implementation so, if
everybody agrees, procede with the rest?

No. Software that is placed under the GNU GPL is *required* to include
a copy of the GNU GPL COPYING file. We haven't so far, which surprised
me, which is why I committed it. It still needs to be added to the
procedure that builds the source and binary distributions...

Harrier,

I suggest you post your suggested *code* (1 RDD), to the list so Ryszard,
Alexander, Alex, etc, can review and post their comments. Or adopt it, to
each respective RDD.

Harrier:
Actually there was one post by Bruno regarding that function.  At the time I
wasn't that familiar with the RDD and didn't know what to add.  But it seems
to me the cl*pper implementation used the Trans and TransRec methods to
transfer data between two different RDDs, and this was the gist of Bruno's
comment.  It would seem that it is the target RDD's responsibility to deal
with file creation.

The default behavior SHOULD always create a new file/table and destroy the
existing one; this is the documented behavior of COPY TO.  It expects that
the target is NOT in an open RDD workarea, and probably throws a sharing
error if it is.

If you want an option to move records to an open table, there will need to
be some parameter or global flag to allow that behavior.  Perhaps it would
be better to add a new command MOVE TO for this?  Or an extra clause in the
header to indicate that an ALIAS is being passed instead of a "file".  This
would make it clear that the programmer wants to move data between open
aliases instead of creating a new table.  If you want to append to an
existing but unopened file, then there needs to be a mechanism to call Open
instead of Create.  This could perhaps be as simple as handling a new
parameter in __dbCopy to create or open as necessary. The current code just
calls rddMoveRecords( ), but wouldn't it make sense to handle the table
opening before calling that?

I partially agree. Trans & TransRec are NOT mandatory on RDD implementation
(I never did them on Clipper) so I assume they do the GETVALUE/PUTVALUE
(rddMoveRecords could be the default). But that is not the point. Allthough
now I get the clarification that COPY TO should copy to a newly created
file, still we have the problem of not having an RDD level (abstract) to
check if a table exists, to delete it if it does, and to create a new one
(without calling Open). So my proposal to add these three functions to the
RDDNode so every RDD can put it's implementation there. The actual dbCreate
shoud be derived to that function and out of a hacjed Open.

Harrier

Subject: [Harbour] NetErr()
Message-ID: <001401c0a903$7ef3d940$921a5e18@bh>

When a USE fails for an existing file, it is not supposed to throw an error,
but instead set NetErr.

Currently, the value for NetErr is a static in dbcmd.c that is only accessed
by HB_FUNC( NETERR ).
But every RDD that opens files has to be able to set that value.  For the
moment, I have added
   s_bNetError = TRUE;
in dbcmd.c (not yet posted) whenever the SELF_OPEN fails.  It would be more
accurate for each rdd to set it only under actual sharing errors, but this
would require either another set/get function or calling NetErr() with the
vmPush stuff, which doesn't seem right.

Is this good enough for government work, or should we implement that static
differently?  Should it perhaps be a member of the area structure (my vote)
??

Subject: RE: [Harbour] GPL + Exception -> Legal Interpretation

I wanted to put my bit tho this Gbs about license :-)

1) About the issues of a modified GPL:
Dave's interpretation of the IF ELSE ENDIF form of the harbour license (HL)
is not wrong, I guess the confusion is saying that FSF/GPL license applies
in Harbour.
Say this: Peter wrote a well known accounting app, after that I take his
code and do the following:
if day()=13 and dow()=6 // Friday
  wipe the hard disk
else
  execute Peter's code
endif
Users of my app could say (regarding what they see on screen everyday) that
it's Peter app, but that's wrong. My app is using lots of his code (all) but
the executable is a new one build my me.
The HL is a new one that includes the terms (not the license as an entity)
described in the GPL. (indeed it may be thought as a derived work! :-) )
It could be easily expressed as:
if (conditions for harbour exception)
  the developer is not bound to the terms of the GPL on account of Harbour
code
else
  copy of the terms of the GPL (actually a reference to them)
endif

2) Freedom to change the code
It was said that changing (forking, etc) the code will erase the harbour
exception, it was also said that it won't.
I'm not sure about this, I guess that the terms of the GPL about a derived
work may force a GPL license into such work. If so and if it's harbour wish
the HL could have one other addition:

NOTE: Wherever the terms of the GPL forces a derived work of Harbour to be
GPL'ed, we allow it to have the HL instead (read the meaning not the words:
English is not my native language !)

By the way: I was wondering if a programmer changes some harbour code,
rebuilds harbour and use it to develop and distribute his apps . Must he
publish his changes?
He's not distributing the modified Harbour compiler, nor the libraries. He's
only distributing the linked libraries and this is covered by the Harbour
exception.
If this it's true then we don't have any problem with the matters about
errorsys.prg and the others.

3) Abuse of Harbour work
In regard of "Ron's" linker (the one that use DLL to work and for use of
it's linked app)
Ron, I think you missed what John pointed out about the distribution of the
DLL. If the evil's linked app must use the harbour's DLLs then we can think
that the linker is actually distributing the libraries for this purpose.
(The linker has them to work but if it links another app to them we can
speak about distribution)

I'll put another evil enviroment that don't require to distribute nothing: a
runner.
A runner could execute Harbour compatible pCode without having an extra copy
of the libraries and that would be the use as it is said in:
"Your use of that
 executable is in no way restricted on account of linking the HRL
 and/or HVM code into it."

I remember (not very well) the license of a commercial C compiler several
years ago that allowed you to build any app you like with the exception of a
another C compiler.

I think that we shoud have that in mind in order to difference the freedom
of the Harbour compiled executables. If they are meant to do what harbour
does by including verbatim code from harbour (compiler, rtl, vm) then they
shoul be out of the harbour exception.

I hope I did not bother you with this :-)

 I'm sure he use it. I use such a font too, but haven't that problem.
 And he has that problem only with Harbour. Other console programs

 including the Clip applications ).

 I'm sure that he use the standard KOI-8r code page, as most of
 Russian Linux users.
 That guy is quite experienced Unix user and he wrote me that ncurses
 and slang isn't a good choice for terminal library because of the
 problems with national code pages and pseudo-graphics.

 BTW, could you check the difference between slang 1.3 and 1.4
 versions and fix the gtsln ( now it doesn't compiles with 1.4 ) ?

Ron,

It's your / your lawyer's view that disagrees with what the license
means, but without giving reasons or enough detail or a fix.

I was trying to make the (obvious I thought) point that in English
(and probably legalese) "link" does not only mean what it means in
the context of a computer software linker.  But: let's stop.  I feel
my para above says it all.  We're wasting vast amounts of time and
effort.

For what it's worth, if your lawyer's right the current license looks
to give at most a slight extra amount of freedom than was intended.
I don't care enough to debate about it any more.

John.

Fine, except: I don't know on which word(s) the current license fails
(in Rin's lawyer's view).  Every time I think I know I find it takes
an age to discover I got it wrong again. :-(

Currently it would be reasonable to believe the license is fine, but
there is a dissenter whose reasons (to me at least) are unknown.

I gave a (somewhat forced) analogy about programming/debugging.  It
continues to be the situation.

Harrier:
OK, I'm seeing the issues better now.  Can we clarify all of them?
I wouldn't expect rdd-level code (in rddMoveRecords for example) to call the
prg-level dbCreate. But it does need to accomplish the same thing, so the
guts of dbCreate really should be abstracted out so the functionality is
available to C code as well as dbCreate itself.   Is this the right starting
point??  Or should __dbCopy just duplicate what pieces are needed to call
SELF_CREATE, etc., to handle it?

Additionally, the old dbCreate did not leave open the target, but this was a
Harbour extension to make that an option, right?
But it takes a parameter to handle this, so that shouldn't be a problem,
should it?

The idea of adding TableExistence methods sounds good, but do we want to
require all RDDs to implement them for core functionality like COPY TO?
And how important is it to implement the option to append to existing
instead of overwriting?

Thanks,

Brian

Luiz:

dbInfo(DBI_FULLPATH) gives the full path to the file.

Are you/Manuel talking about the actual file handle for the open dbf?
Since the goal of ADS is to use the remote server, that won't ever be
available.  Because of this, I doubt the Local Server DLLs make the file
handle available either (I couldn't find it in the help file, and since the
DLL opens the files I'm not completely sure it could share it with the EXE
if it wanted.)  At any rate, even if it did, any code written for it would
fail when using the Remote Server since that's another process on another
machine, so I think Manuel will have to find a different way to do what he
wants.  Have him forward the actual goal, and I'll see if there's another
way to handle it.

I've been hacking around Harbour code (debugging) and now I also have things
more clear... The virtual functions table is in the place I would expect, so
that makes things simpler. I see the extra parameter on dbCreate that allows
the file to be also opened or not (on Clipper it was always expected it to
be, so that is a good thing, does this mean that my rddCreate function will
be able to get this information? How? I found an ISLOG( 4 ) on DBCREATE
(dbcmd.c), how this can be passed to the RDD?

On the COPY to issue, I think that a DBOEXIST functionality is VERY useful,
at least TOPConnect programmers make heavy use of it as to create the needed
tables at run time, I also think that it should not be difficult to
implement on the DBF file based RDDs. I plan to allow Index existence test
as well. I also find a missing an DBDROP functionality. Maybe all of them
were non important when dealing with DBF files, where you could always go to
the operating system file functions to check & delete a table, but this is
not the case on a "really" abstract RDD layer, where you just cannot know
what a table really is, or, in other words, you the dine the functionality
of such an entity, not it's physical existence.

You are right on the issue of dbCreate being a prg-level routine, but
rddMoveRecords can happily call SELF_CREATE as DBCRATE does filling the
proper arguments (not too much code). After experimenting with a Clipper
program I see that COPY TO will delete an existing target table and create a
new one. Is this behavior what Clipper-heads want? Making this
deletion/creation is not possible on an RDD as TOPConnect without the
DBEXIST functionality.Maybe the flag that you talk about is the best
solution as to append records to an existing table is a good choice. Another
flag that would be nice is  to enable by-field-name-copy, this can be very
useful when moving data between the ever changing record layouts.

I have just downloaded the latest CVS and will have time this week to make
my proposal. I will not change to the TRANS/TRANSREC functionality because,
to remain abstract, the Put/GetValue are the only methods that are mandatory
to the RDD and do the work, another level of functions in the middle seems
more complicated (I like MIS) and affects performance as well.

Ill keep you (all) posted, unless the list says something on the contrary.

Subject: [Harbour] National collation sequences
Message-ID: <185859113.20010312102527@belacy.belgorod.su>

 I suggest to place the files with subj and with national ipper(),
 lower() to the same directory where the national message files are -
 source/lang and to call them srtXXXXX.c .
 I don't see the reason why
 they should be different for each RDD ( ntxXXXXX, cdxXXXXXX, as it is
 in CA-CLipper now ).
 Probably, it could be useful to provide a possibility to link several
 national files and select it with some additional clause of USE
 command.
 
 Any opinions ?

 In this case NetErr() will take the result from current workarea and
 in this case:

  select a
  use test  // failed
  select b
  ? neterr()

  will return .f. .
  So I suggest to have it as a member of the workarea structure and
  keep the existing static s_bNetError. RDD will set the value of the
  variable from the workarea and appropriate function in dbcmd will
  check it and set s_bNetError . In this case we could add new
  function ( AreaNetErr() ? ), which will return the error status for
  the selected workarea.

This is a messega I got from Jose Gimenez:

I'm working on accesing COM interfaces for Harbour (it's almost finished)
and I've found a BUG in Harbour.
You can verify it running this little program:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

#include "Fivewin.ch"

PROCEDURE main()

   LOCAL o, n := 1

   MsgInfo( n, "Before change" )  // result: 1
   o:=test():new()
   o:change( @n )                 // Passed by reference
   MsgInfo( n, "After change" )   // result: Clipper: 1234
                                  //         Harbour: 1
RETURN


STATIC PROCEDURE ChangeNum( x )
   x := 1234
RETURN


CLASS test
METHOD new() CONSTRUCTOR
METHOD change( n ) INLINE ChangeNum( @n ) // Passed by reference
ENDCLASS


METHOD new() CLASS test
RETURN Self

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

As you can see, if a parameter is passed by reference to a inline method of
a class, this parameter is dereferenced.

I've modified only 1 line (1980) in CLASSES.C from VM directory and now it's
working fine.

Currently, my RDD has the following code, when the Open fails, and it works
fine:

    SHORT  RetVal;
    pError = hb_errNew();

    hb_errPutGenCode( pError, ErrNro );
    hb_errPutSubCode( pError, 0 );

    hb_errPutSeverity( pError, ES_WARNING );

    hb_errPutFlags( pError, EF_CANDEFAULT );
    hb_errPutDescription( pError, aErrMsg[14] );  <-- this is my message

    RetVal = SUPER_ERROR( (AREAP)pArea, pError );
    hb_errRelease( pError );
    return ( RetVal );

After this, NetErr() is True.

Message-ID: <007901c0ab1b$019c96c0$c06410ac@jharrier>

Now that Im going into the code to implement COPY TO with table
overwritting, I understand what Brian said about DBCREATE being at the
prg-level as opossed to the C-level code. But my question goes beyond; I see
DBCREATE completely mixed up with DBOPEN, as a matter of fact it builds up a
DBOPENINFO structure to pass to the RDD. Why is this so? Did the
Clipper-heads think that table creation was a "kind of" table opening? It
has to create a new WorkArea and all the stuff... I see this very twisted.
In my opinion DBCREATE should receive the structure and pass it to the RDD
for table creation WITHOUT a WorkArea involved! As I see, ALL virtual
functions have an asociated AREAP as it's first parameter, why? I pretend
the DBEXIT, DBDROP & DBEXIST functions wich operate with no WorkArea at all,
as they are Database level (as DBCREATE should be), not table instance ones.

Any comments?

In order to change this, somebody who has both of the source archives
(Wintel and Linux) needs to upload them and issue a release for 0.36.

Is this really the case in Clipper ? For instance, I use NTXGER.OBJ for
German collation together with DBFCDX driver in Clipper 5.3. There is no
CDXGER.OBJ, NTXGER.OBJ is the file to be used with all RDDs.

No. You just need to export the shell variables identified in the file
doc/gmake.txt and then run "make -r" to build Harbour and the libraries.
You can also export the various HB_*_INSTALL shell variables (also
identified in the file doc/gmake.txt) and run "make -r install" to
install the binaries and libraries to the directories of your choice.

There is also a make_gnu.sh shell script that you can use.

If I ever get the clear time to have a crack at it, perhaps. I wouldn't
count on anything happening any time soon though.

None of that is necessary if he's got the source RPM. All that's required
with the source RPM is:

,----
| rpm --rebuild harbour-0.36-1.src.rpm
`----

and a binary RPM will be produced. He can then install the binary RPM with:

,----
| rpm -i harbour-0.36-1.i386.rpm
`----

then read /usr/doc/harbour-0.39/README.RPM.

Message-ID: <001501c0ab4d$f153db10$c06410ac@jharrier>

As I advance on the implementation of COPY TO with table overwritting, I'm
looking at more weird stuff... DBEXIT, DBDROP & DBEXISTS were easy, even on
dbf1.c (which uses fsDelete & fsFile for the purpose), but DBCREATE... it's
completely out of place! I'm beginning to think that the Clipper-heads that
designed the RED architecture were no OOP wizards, had only a partial idea
of abstraction a less yet about "separation of concerns". Take the dbInfo()
example, many of the asked items have no connection to a particular instance
of a table, they refer to the Database properties. Did they put a WorkArea
pointer on every function just to have access to the virtual table function
on SELF_ stuff?, but that table is known to the RDD! Why SUPER_ goes
directly, but SELF_ doesn't?. Okay, functions at the DataBase level are very
few, but that's not an argument. And dbCreate IS at the DatBase level , not
a table instance one. The bad news is that putting this straight would break
every RDD's code (what I've done up to now has no impact). I need the
Harbour crew to get the point & agree on doing it, I can of course change
the RDD's under SOURCE/RDD, but that's not enough. My proposal is that
dbCreate receives a DBCREATEINFO with the needed information (table name,
fields and whatever), and that it does it's job without any connection to
dbOpen.

Comments please.

Of course, that final step is reserved for a future release. :)

Not quite. Ron and I were talking about what's needed and what could be done
just a few days ago. Check the archives.

However, while you're at it, the attached patch could do with being applied
to TERROR.PRG.

You can use
Set HI=c:\harbour\include
harbour filefunc /m /n /i%HI% | bcc32 -c -O2 -I%HI% filefunc.c |echo
+-filefunc.obj & >>lib.rsp

Btw in few days Ill finish the library support for the hbmake utility

Dear Friend

If your proposed changes, makes the copy command work , i dont see any
problem to you change the source\rdd, but with care to not damage the
current implementation

Harrier:
You might try contacting Ryszard directly to see how your ideas mesh with
what he's proposed about revamping the rdd.  Did you see the msg he put up a
month or two ago with restructuring ideas?  It would be good to review it.

FWH provides a SAMPLES\buildh.bat file that clearly shows
how to generate an OBJ from a PRG file.

Many FW users are used to batch files, so that is
the starting point :-)

Noberto,

  Use the command SET() with the parameter _SET_OPTIMIZE

  For the set multiple, I think we will have to wait that Harbour is 
multithreading !

SET MULTIPLE ON is not needed as the same 32 bits app may be 
executed simultaneously no matter how many times.

 What about me, I didn't read yet that thread about license.
 Have you come to the final solution ?

 Since DBFCDX isn't default RDD, you should insert these two lines:

   request _DBFCDX
   rddRegister( "DBFCDX", 1 )

   before
     RDDSETDEFAULT("DBFCDX") .

David,

I do care, and still want to us to address the problem I raised regarding
the lack of qualification on what kind of Executables can link HVM/HRL, and
still be excused from GPL.

It makes no sense, that we will allow a 3rd. party to develop just the
compiler front end, and ship a full fledge package utilizing the HVM & HRL,
without having to disclose this fact.

This is especially true, since, you and few others think that the current
text [already] does not allow it, and yet a copyright expert claims it does.
It only makes sense to clear such reported ambiguity.

What do you think about adding to the Exception:

,----------------------------------------------------------------
| as long as the HVM and/or HRL are not supporting code generated
| by a NON FREE (NON GPL?) Harbour compatible compiler.
`----------------------------------------------------------------

We also have to address the issue of applying the Exception to modified
HVM/HRL.

Harbour License".

Not yet, which is why I started the new thread with a proposed rewrite
of the Harbour Exception that is nearly identical to the entire Guile
Exception.

I did reply but it seems the reply was lost in the DNS troubles[1]. IIRC I
raised two points. One was to ask where you found the longer version of the
guile exception (back when I looked at it there didn't appear to be such a
verbose version), the second was to ask if you'd mind annotating what you
think the harbour version of this actually says.

Actually, one more point occurs to me. Some thought might need to be given
to *how* we'd change the exception.

Seeking to stop such a thing would be the opposite of the harbour exception
wouldn't it? That is, wouldn't we be seeking to add *more* restrictions as
opposed to removing them (which is what the harbour exception does)?

Unless I've totally missed the gist of the discussions that have taken place
the thing that people said wasn't allowed had nothing to do with non-free
compilers making use of the HVM and HRTL. I thought the example that was
being discussed was the "evil linker using HVM/HRTL as binary cargo", which
is quite different.

There's a huge hole in this that could cause problems: who gets to decide
the definition of "free"? Another hole in the wording of the above is that
there's every chance the HRL would be supporting code generated by a
non-free compiler, some C compilers are non-free and the HRL provides the
extend system.

1) I downloaded guile-1.4.tar.gz from the download page that is
accessible from  http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html

2) I'll do that in another post when I have more time.

Did you read the proposed Harbour Exception that I based upon the full
Guile Exception? In my opinion, it deals with all of your concerns and
the extra clauses (copied from the Guile Exception) plug the holes that
your lawyer claims exist.

No, it simply further qualifies what kind of Executable *is* entitled to the
removal of these restrictions, or "deserves" the relief of the Exception.

I suggest that the "evil" scenario was just on example of how the Exception

1. This is why I put (NON GPL?). I', not sure what the legal term is.
2. Please note it doesn't say NON FREE Compiler, it says NON FREE *Harbour*

Ahh, ok. I wonder if the exception has been clarified in 1.4 then. IIRC it
was either 1.2 or 1.3 that was doing the rounds when I pointed to the (less
verbose) exception.

Yes I did read it, and I don't think it fully addresses my concern. I think
my proposed 1 sentence amendment will resolve this concern, without adding
restrictions to the intended freedom, and without adding complex language.

I reviewed the archives and think I understand what needs to be done.

But it looks as though you already presented the solution.  Is this a
"mere" matter of patching, integrating, and testing?  Or is more research
needed?

Uh, Dave, this looks like the same thing.  Or am I not getting your

Jose:
Did Jose Gimenez see the feedback about the File System fixes you posted for
him?
It was a great idea, but it broke several things and we had to disable it.
Do you know if he reads this list?  Please extend an invitation to
participate on the list; he seems to be involved in several projects that we
all could benefit from.

THE 'SAVE TO' statement doesn't work like clipper's.
   i.e.
   like nom?? works for nom10, but not for nom1

Now that's just ridiculous.  Nobody uses SAVE TO anyway.

(Just kidding.)

I'll check it out in my CFT.

BTW, who do I talk to about CVS access?

Jose does not monitor the Harbour list. He post his messages to me so I can
forward them to the Harbour list.
I will ask him to join the list. He is a great programmer.

He just send me a test class so we can connect to any 32 bits COM object.
OLE, OLEODB, ADO,.. All possible with Harbour!

I have alraedy a connection with FUNCky6 and Harbour.

I'm not sure I follow what you're driving at here and above. In the above
you seem concerned with some form of disclosure while here you seem more
concerned with how and when the exception can be applied. I'm not sure that
I can see how the two are related.

As you may recall I could see some merit in your "evil" example. However,
writing a non-free compiler that produces output that can be used with the
HVM and HRTL isn't the same thing is it?

I think requiring the GPL would be a bad idea. That is to say, there are
other free software licences available (and other free software licences are
still waiting to be written).

Ahh, yes, I missed that. I can see that defining "harbour compatible" could
be an interesting exercise.

You can tell harbour where to find include files:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~$ harbour | grep include
|           -i<path>         #include file search path
`----

Telling your "linker" where your library files are is a GCC issue. If you've
got the RPM installed (I seem to recall that you have) you can have a look
at /usr/bin/harbour-link for some ideas on how this is done.

BTW, your questions are much better suited to the harbour-users mailing
list.

The patch simply ensures that :args has the correct default value.
Populating :args with useful values when a BASE error is thrown is a
different issue (that's the issue that Ron and I were discussing).

OK:

As it turns out, the Harbour Exception consist of only a small
section of the actual Guile Exception to the GNU GPL. I have
just today obtained a full copy of the Guile License, which I
have adapted to refer to Harbour and the Harbour Project and
would become the new content of doc/license.txt, if approved
(and would also be included in doc/hdr_tpl.txt, minus the
first paragraph):

The license of Harbour consists of the GNU GPL plus a special statement
giving blanket permission to link with non-free software.  This is the
license statement as found in any individual file that it applies to:

 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

 along with this software; see the file COPYING.  If not, write to
 the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
 Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA (or visit the web site http://www.gnu.org/).

 As a special exception, the Harbour Project gives permission for
 additional uses of the text contained in its release of Harbour.

 The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other
 files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
 resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
 Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of
 linking the Harbour library code into it.

 This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
 the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

 This exception applies only to the code released by the Harbour
 Project under the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other
 Harbour Project or Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of
 Harbour, as the General Public License permits, the exception does
 not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid misleading
 anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete
 this exception notice from them.

 If you write modifications of your own for Harbour, it is your choice
 whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
 If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.

I RALLY WANT TO APPOLOGIZE that I have not answer You so far !!!

The only reason for this is that I did not received Your mail from
a list server. In fact I did not received many other mails too !!!
I got to know that when I downloaded mail archives from Phil's
matrixlist server and looked at them!!!

PLEASE FORGIVE ME !!!

I though You simply did mot respond to my mail.

I think it is VERY possible that I did not received mails adressed
to me from other pepople too. If so PLEASE FORGIVE ME too !!!

Seems to me now that something wrong must be with my mailbox, but
because I have rather hard internet access I can probably do nothing
with this.

Alexander and others - PLEASE ACCEPT MY APPOLOGIES !!

PS.
I will try to answer You in a separate mail because I have to read
this one carefully.

with respect to all Your work

You can post small fixes to the list and someone can post it for you (I'd be

Or, read up on the FAQ for the HowTo stuff, and make an official

 There was problems on matrixlist last few days. I didn't receive
 some messages too, including David's "Proposed Rewording of the
 Harbour License", Brian's "NetErr()" and others.

 And yet another problem with gtsln ( the same with gtcrs ) - it
 doesn't show some symbols with codes above 128 ( Russian characters
 ), replacing them with \0xFE ( little black square ) and doesn't
 allow to input them.

Well, I've re-read it about five times and I'm thinking about it.

I was going to post a question tonight regarding the pro's and con's 
of it.

not an actual code, but the docs would benefit from anyone willing
to spend some (probably alot of) time to write missing parts of the
docs. at the moment less than 50% of the functions are documented.

So maybe the problem is different ?

Could You please ask Your friend to compile attached ascii.c program 
and run it redirecting output to a file then send this file to my 
private address ? Maybe this can help me to see what is wrong.

I think that there are much more problems with terminal handling under
Unix environment other than national code pages and pseudo-graphics.
One of a most important is keyboard handling even on standard 437 code
page. To my knoledge there is no possibility to provide all that
CTRL+SpecialKeys and ALT+Keys Dos funcionality under Unix in general
meaning (I mean hundreds of different terminals, most of them with
very limited properties ). Yet another problem is displaying characters
with code less than 32. There are many usefull chars in Dos there, but
due to the fact that such chars are control chars under Unix, either for
system and for terminals, I don't think they can be displayd properly
in all Unixes and all terminals. All these problems and some more were
described in gtslang.txt by me.

So generally I wouldn't expect 100% compatibility with Clipper under
Unix. We can reach better compatibility in some environments but not
in all cases.

I made an attempt to solve these problems by developing a gt driver
based on X11 library. It works in XWindows and emulates a text console
with 437 code page. Although it solves problems with chars less than
32, pseudo-graphics chars, keyboard handling and screen resizing
( currently not with other code pages ) when a proper font is used,
unfortunately it introduces new incompatibilities with Clipper. Because
it is not a full terminal emulation, it is not possible to run other
programs from within Harbour programs directly. Instead it is necessary
to run them thru something like :

RUN "xterm -e <other unix program>"

It also has the same problem with Harbour OutXXX() functions as ncurses
and slang drivers have (which I described in one of my previous posts)
and possibly, other currently unknown to me problems (code pages ?), so
I think it also is not a good solution too.

I think a discussion should be started to find a proper solution, but
I don't think we have more choices than ncurses and slang  under Unix
( and maybe X11 ???? - but it needs more work in current time ).

In my opinion the future is a GUI layer based on a portable library
which will slowly force moving old aplications to a new environment.
Being inspired by Antonio's FWH, I am currently playing with Harbour 
and GTK library under Linux and Win98 and I am trying to play with 
QT library as well.

>  BTW, could you check the difference between slang 1.3 and 1.4

I am suprised here.

I successfully compiled slang driver with a following environment :

   Slang 1.22  RedHat 6.0
   Slang 1.38  Mandrake 6.1
   Slang 1.40  RedHat 7.0
   Slang 1.41  RedHat 7.0
   Slang 1.44  RedHat 7.0
   Slang 1.22  Dos+Djgpp

and had no problems. This of course does not mean there are no
problems at all, but I can not figure them ! Is there anyone who
had similar problems with compilation of slang driver too ?

What is Your configuration when You compile gtsln ?
Does <slang include files> are in a proper place ?
The driver expects them in a  /usr/include/slang/ dir.
Could You send me a short errlog from compilation to my
private address as well as script You used to compile ?
Could You send your slang.h to my private address too ?
And could You also privately describe me shortly KOI-8r
code page ? Maybe I am missing something obvious.

I would be appreciate.

And about the differencies.

If we are talking about terminal handling part of Slang library
(not all Slang library) there is no big difference between at least
Slang 1.38 and Slang 1.44. Only bug fixes and small enhancemets
(up to my knowledge of course). And even Slang 1.22 does not differ
much in this part.

And finally I would like to say my appologies yet another time,
that I did not respond to Your mail in a proper time. It really
was not my fault. Only because of a lucky case I downloaded mail
archives and founded Your mail. Sorry again.

Best Regards
Marek Paliwoda

Harrier:
A minor point on your comments re Trans being optional:
There is a function __dbTrans() that is currently stubbed out in dummy.prg.
I have never used it, but I did some scanning around and there are 3rd party
libs that have called it from PRG code.  Ultimately it seems we should have
this function, which I presume is a front end for the Trans rdd methods.

I was previously unfamiliar with these functions, and you obviously knew
about them,
so if you think it's more efficient to go straight to Get/PutValue for
append and CopyTo, that's probably OK.  But it appears that the "Trans"
level of abstraction would handle some issues for To/From Delimited and SDF
as well as the related codeblocks for scoping and filtering.

So I guess this msg gets down to:  do we lose any functionality by not
having copyTo/AppendFrom use Trans?  And even if not,  am I correct in
concluding that Harbour's base RDD needs to implement it anyway to support
other existing code?

Thanks,
Brian

You are quite right, but I still think that DBAPPEND & COPY TO will get far
more complicated if it has to build up the Trans stuff and use it, not to
say we should implement them. I don't rely know the internals of the Trans
functionality... It seem to me that it's a short cut on record moving when
you KNOW IN ADVANCE the layout of them, which is not the case on copy
functions. I will investigate the issue. If someone has more Info about it I
will appreciate.

Harrier

I've finished the implementation of DBAPPEND and DBCOPY, I've try it with
the default RDD and it works fine (Until I got read of the memory leaks,
what a hell!). Now COPY TO deletes the target table and recreates it, as
Clipper does. I left the option of adding a parameter in the future to allow
for appending. I also addeed the DBEXIT (for RDD cleanup), DBDROP (for table
deleting) and DBEXISTS (for table/index verification), this two last ones I
implemented them on DBF1.C, though I didn't know where to get the Index
extension, so that has to be completed. I have seen no impact on the rest of
Harbour, so you tell me. I have incorporated to DBCMD.C the code previously
on RDDCPY.C.

One thing that I had to do was to bring up, to hbapirdd.h the RDDNODE
definition, this was to implement the three new functions that do not relay
on a table instance. I would have liked to put into this category dbCreate,
but that would break all the code, so I need the input from the other RDD
gurus to make such a change. I have given my reasons why this should be so
on previous messages.

I'm attaching a zip with the harbour directory structure containing the
files that were modified.

Anyone for a try?

Harrier

Ryszard:
Would it help the GC issues if there were a PRG-callable function to destroy
arrays or codeblocks for real once the programmer is sure he/she is done
with it?
    _KillItem(bBlock)

There are lots of situations (closing of a window, for example) where many
items could get cleaned up directly rather than waiting for an idle state of
some sort.  In the case of large arrays this would give some control over
when the memory can be recovered.

Or would this create two many hard-to-debug problems when the wise
programmer forgets it was embedded in a codeblock somewhere?

A thing I forgot to mention is that I "fixed" the mess with
DBOPENINFO.abName. As it was, this field was being x_grabbed on DBUSEAREA
and the the pointer copied to the WorkAreas FileName. I changed this so each
WorkArea x_grabs the space and the copies the contents to it. Of couse I
added the x_free to dbfClose and DBUSEAREA. It seems to me that each level
shoud deal with its own grab/free issues.

 Yes, in case of work from the remote terminal there is a lot of

 software, termcaps, etc.
 But we can expect, I think, that if we work from the console, it
 should be Ok, isn't it ?

Brian,

Probably. :-(

Calls such as these sound fairly safe:
1. immediate full GC run - IIRC this is HB_GCALL()
2. disable GC (*)
3. (re-)enable GC
4. internal data structure consistency (validity) check
5. re-alloc/move as many things as possible (so pointers change)
   - might as well call #4 next!

(*) presumably the app will eat memory until #3 is used (and GC runs)

#2 is risky in more than the obvious way (possibly huge memory usage),
in that if an app fails without it and works with it it's then very
easy to blame the GC, whereas it may well just be that an old pointer
had not been properly cleaned up (or set NULL or ...).

I failed to persuade CA to do these. :-(  I think the idea is that
programmers either don't make pointer/logic errors or find them so
soon that they're not important.  If only.

John.

OK. Following is a copy of the proposed Harbour Exception with my
annotations of what I think that it is actually saying.

>  As a special exception, the Harbour Project gives permission for
>  additional uses of the text contained in its release of Harbour.

The above part appears to be simply a successful attempt to increase
the verbosity of the exception, but is probably there for some specific
legal reason...

>  The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other
>  files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the

>  Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of

The above paragraph is essentially identical to the one that has been
beaten to death on this very mailing list. The only difference is that
I've replaced the overly verbose references to the HRL and the HVM with
"libraries".

The reason why is that the exception only applies to binary code
created from source code that includes the Harbour Exception. So it is
sufficient to reference "libraries" instead of specifying *which*
libraries. For example, the Pre-Processor isn't technically part of
either the HRL or the HVM, but it *is* covered by the Harbour Exception,
which means that an executable created from Harbour that includes the PP
library would not be automatically excluded from the Harbour Exception,
even if the exception only specifically mentioned the HRL and the HVM.
(Harbour itself *is* excluded from the Harbour Exception, because core
components of the source code used to build the compiler do *not*
include the exception.)

>  This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
>  the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

The above paragraph explicitly voids the claim by Ron's lawyer that
just linking in the libraries exempts the executable from any and all
clauses of the GNU GPL.

>  This exception applies only to the code released by the Harbour
>  Project under the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other
>  Harbour Project or Free Software Foundation releases into a copy of

>  this exception notice from them.

The above paragraph means that, for example, if someone were to add
Guile to Harbour and release it on their own instead of committing the
changes back to the Harbour Project CVS, then the Harbour Exception
would not apply to the Guile code, but would still apply to the Harbour
code and the Guile Exception would still apply to the Guile code, so the
net result would be that the derivative "Harbour with Guile" would be
covered by both the Harbour Exception and the Guile Exception.

However, if someone were to add code from a pure GNU GPL project to
Harbour, then the code from the other project would *not* inherit the
Harbour Exception, which would mean that the Harbour Exception would not
apply to any executable created from this derivative Harbour.

>  If you write modifications of your own for Harbour, it is your choice
>  whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
>  If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.

The above paragraph means that if you modify Harbour independently of
the Harbour Project, then you can remove the exception from any source
code that you modify (but you can't *add* it to any source code and you
*can't* remove it from source code that you *haven't* modified). The net
result would be that executables created from your derivative version of
Harbour would *not* be covered by the Harbour Exception if the resulting
executable included code from modules that you modified and removed the
Harbour Exception from.

For example, if you modify source/rtl/trim.c and remove the Harbour
Exception, then if I use your derivative version of Harbour, but don't
use any of the functions from the trim.c module and that module does
*not* get linked into my executable, then my resulting executable might
*still* be eligible for the Harbour Exception. But, if the trim module
*were* to be linked in (for example, if I used "REQUEST TRIM" somewhere
in my source code), then my executable would *not* be eligible for the
Harbour Exception, because it now includes code that was built from
source that no longer contained the exception.

Be aware that the ADS RDD and others will have to be updated to include at
least DBDROP & DBEXISTS for this to work properly.

Message-ID: <200103151817.f2FIHQS11678@smtp.parrett.net>

With a filter set that skips a lot of records DBSKIP() can *not* be
terminated using Ctrl+Break! It just keeps going, even though
"terminated at DBSKIP(0)" is displayed for every press of Ctrl+Break.
I'm not sure if this is a generic DBSKIP problem or only an ADS DBSKIP
problem, because I only use ADS/CDX.

Does this mean we NEED to use DBEXIT?

NO, dbExit will only be called if defined. See hb_rddShutDown( void ) on
DBCMD.C . The RDDs must change their RDDFUNCS table, anyhow, to include the
new slots, allthough dbExit can be NULL. DBEXISTS & DBDROP should be
implemented for COPY TO to work.

  I think that we should add a single RDD entry only named for example 
'rddCall'. This should accept a numeric index into an extension function, 
similar to ordInfo and dbInfo. This way only a single new entry will be 
needed in RDD table and this will allow to support RDD specific calls 
without rebuilding virtual tables in drivers that doesn't support a given 
function.
  At least this is what I have done in the new RDD version that I am 
working on.

I like your idea. Maybe with some #defines for clarity pourposes. On the
other hand, dbDrop & dbExists are now callable at the PRG level:
if dbexists( "MYFILE", "", "MY_RDD" )
    dbdrop( "MYFILE", "MY_RDD" )
endif

Hi,

  Why if I'm linking the standard errorsys of clipper with my 
application  the procedure Errorsys is executed but the application 
never started ?

  But if I take the Deferror() function and Errormessage() function 
from errorsys.prg and I add those function to my program and I add 
a call in my main program to Errorblock() everything is working.

Hi,

  Sorry for this one I finally found the problem, for whom that didn't 
use Ilink32 and BC5.5 before: 
 
 The first object after the C0?32.obj must be your starting program

  Sorry if I disturb Harbour developper with this one ! ;(, but I think 
this information will be usefull for Clipper user. I didn't touch any 
other language and Linker since Clipper Winter 85 !

  One error still remain the one related for FPT file ! Any clue ?

  Thank you,

> What is it a twirler ?

It sequentially displays various characters in the same screen location
to indicate progress. Also known as a spinner. The twirler uses the
characters |, /, -, and \ by default. The test program (tests/twirl.prg)
shows other variations, including a throbber, that uses the characters,
., o, O, and o.

When we are talking about *LINUX* console - probably yes.

But there are oher Unixes in a world and things are stil very complicated.
For example I have an access to Sco OpenServer with its console set on
a PC (exactly like in linux) but this console is rather limited too. In fact,
tricks must be done to force it work good.
And what about such Unixes like HP - based on non PC computers ? They
usualy have a console set on a terminal by default (and it could be the same
for linux, Sco and others, when working in a specific environments). I have
an access to HPUX and can say that even administrative work I try to do
from a terminal emulation, not from console, because I find it very unusable .

So I still think the compatibility is a big problem. But of course I fully
agree that EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE to reach maximum point
of compatibility, at least in LINUX.

Subject: [Harbour] Potential NTX and CDX problems?
Message-ID: <200103162026.f2GKQ5r04042@smtp.parrett.net>

I get the following warnings with RSXNT:

First for NTX:

> gcc -I. -I../../../../../include -Zwin32 -Wall  -c ../../dbfntx1.c -odbfntx1.o
> ../../dbfntx1.c: In function `hb_ntxIndexCreate':
> ../../dbfntx1.c:1655: warning: unknown conversion type character `*' in format
> ../../dbfntx1.c:1655: warning: too many arguments for format

That's for this sprintf call:

> sprintf( szBuffer, "%0*.0*f", pTag->KeyLength,
>        pTag->KeyDec, hb_numRound( hb_itemGetND( pItem ),
>        pTag->KeyDec ) );

And:

> ../../dbfntx1.c:1663: warning: unknown conversion type character `*' in format
> ../../dbfntx1.c:1663: warning: too many arguments for format

Which is for this sprintf call:

> sprintf( szBuffer, "%0*.0*f", pTag->KeyLength,
>        pTag->KeyDec, hb_itemGetND( pItem ) );

Based in the compiler not complaining about sprintf calls that use
"%0*li", I am assuming that the problem is with the "*f" part of the
"%0*.0*f" format specifier.

Then for CDX:

> gcc -I. -I../../../../../include -Zwin32 -Wall  -c ../../dbfcdx1.c -odbfcdx1.o
> ../../dbfcdx1.c:169: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type

This turns out to be due to the DBFCDX code not having table entries
for 
DBENTRYP_I0, DBENTRYP_I1, or DBENTRYP_I2, which are supposed to appear
ahead of DBENTRYP_SVP, which is the last entry in the table.

The remaining warnings don't appear to be critical:

> ../../dbfcdx1.c:3256: warning: suggest parentheses around + or - inside shift

Perhaps he didn't? Perhaps he built a DOS version with DJGPP?

 As it seems, some compilers doesn't accept the second '0' in
 "%0*.0*f" ( it is Ok with BC ).
 Now fixed - changed to "%0*.*f" - and, what is interesting, with BC
 it gives the same result, as the old format string.

Subject: [Harbour] ScopeValue passed to RDDs
Message-ID: <000f01c0af7f$0640eec0$921a5e18@bh>

ordScope() was originally coded to only accept a string.  Since several data
types are valid, I fixed the parameter checking, but we need a decision on
what gets passed to SELF_SETSCOPE.

Do we convert everything to a string value in ordscope and always set
sInfo.scopeValue to this string (which would work OK with ADS but doesn't
seem most flexible), OR do we change ordScope to always pass down the item,
and have all RDDs responsible for converting item contents to appropriate
values?

BTW, what is the best way to convert a numeric item (potentially int or
double) to a string representation?

[There's not really a "Linux flavour" of the source, but...] You can get
DOS/WinTel formatted source code from the same place that you can get Un*x
formatted source code: <URL:http://www.harbour-project.org/download.htm>.
Grab the source ZIP file.

Note that if you want to be playing with source from a development point of
view (you posted this to the developers mailing list so I'm guessing you do)
then you'd probably do better to grab the latest source from the CVS server.
The harbour FAQ contains lots of information on how to get anonymous CVS
access working on your machine.

 Dave, I just read the harbour.spec from your site and have found the
 following:
 
* Thu Aug 24 2000 Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>
- Changed the files section so that hbrun doesn't get installed. It isn't
  useful on GNU/Linux systems.

  Don't know, when and how this happens :), but it seems that hbrun
  works on  Linux now, so there is a sense to uncomment the
  '%{prefix}/bin/hbrun' .

 Don't know, is it the best way, but I used for it the sprintf()

"is a sense"? There was a time when hbrun simply refused to work on
GNU/Linux boxen (or I couldn't make it work anyway). I take it it does work
now? I've changed the .spec file so that it's installed again.

When I get a spare moment I'll cut a new RPM. It'll take longer for the
.spec file to make it onto my web site 'cos I've got server troubles at the
moment and the box that's hosting my pages as an interim measure doesn't
allow me rsync/ssh access.

Thanks for the heads-up.

Not sure. After the fiber cut was fixed, they did an ugly reboot of 
the box.

Other than that, I'm not sure what happened.

It seems unlikely that this is the cause, considering your email 
addredd, but competition makes strange bedfellows, so one never

  I don't think so, because the url above tell about lost messages
  from EarthLink users to AOL, but I haven't any relation to these
  companies.
  I still don't receive any messages from Harbour lists - yours I read on
  matrixlist.com .

 No, only www.harbour-project.org ( I used tracert for checking ).
 But I think that I didn't see it before too, because my mailer never
 could resolve lists.harbour-project.org and deliver the message
 directly - only via my ISP system.
 But, as you see, I'm still able to write to the list - only have no

The reason I ask is that the internet is a less trusting place these days,
mostly thanks to the efforts of those who think that UCE is a good method of
advertising goods and services. Some MTAs will silently drop any email that
has an envelope that comes from an unresolvable location.

There's a chance that an MTA between Phil's machine and your machine is
doing exactly this to try and make sure that the amount of UCE you received
is reduced. The downside of this is that if it can't resolve the envelope
sender of harbour list mails it's going to treat them exactly the same.

I was hit by this when I reworked my local network so that all the machines
internally used davep.org in their names (hagbard.davep.org, rama.davep.org,
eris.davep.org, darwin.davep.org, and so on). Messages were being sent out
with an envelope from davep@hagbard.davep.org. Some people received such
email, others didn't (most notably people at Compu$erve (Hi John!)). Once
I'd fixed the configuration of sendmail on hagbard so that the envelope was
masqueraded as just davep.org (not hagbard.davep.org) every worked fine.

Note that in all of this no bounce messages could or would have been
produced because the domain mentioned in the envelope wasn't resolvable so
there was nowhere to return the bounce to.

What is interesting is that you can't see lists.harbour-project.org. Has
this always been the case or is it a recent thing (I note that you say
"never" but I feel compelled to double check with you)? Patrick's changes to
DNS the other week resulted lists.harbour-project.org disappearing for some
of us but it's back now. Did it disappear recently? If so perhaps there's a
broken name server near you?

Hmm, this would almost suggest that your ISP has no problems but that it's
your machine that's silently ignoring mails from domains that can't be
resolved. Are you running any kind of UCE protection on your own machine?

Which means that you *are* receiving messages. You just aren't getting
a *lot* of messages, because there has been *very* little traffic
recently! Alexander isn't getting *any* messages, which is quite another

Message-ID: <001e01c0b22a$a45b6ec0$2db572c3@map>

Hi,

    I am getting random GPFs in ac_test.exe program created 
under MingW32 environment, when it ends. 

The trace log is as follow :

(gdb) bt
#0  0x412fb6 in hb_codeblockDelete ()
#1  0x40d032 in hb_itemClear ()
#2  0x41ebd7 in hb_errExit ()
#3  0x4020df in hb_vmQuit ()
#4  0x401e94 in main ()
#5  0x4011b1 in __mingw_CRTStartup ()
#6  0x4011cf in mainCRTStartup ()
#7  0xbff8b560 in _size_of_stack_reserve__ ()
#8  0xbff8b412 in _size_of_stack_reserve__ ()
#9  0xbff89dd5 in _size_of_stack_reserve__ ()

Is it possible that this error is related to recent GC changes ? 

Seems to me it can be. In errorapi.c

    static HB_ITEM s_errorBlock;

is declared and filled thru hb_itemCopy(), so it can be released 
by GC too ealier ( or I am missing something ).

After I locally fixed errorapi.c by changing it from

    static HB_ITEM s_errorBlock;
to
    static HB_ITEM_PTR s_errorBlock;,

and assigning it a new item from hb_itemNew( NULL ), and also 
changing all references to s_errorBlock acording to that modification,
a problem disapeared.

The funny thing is that under Djgpp and Linux I could not 
reproduce it.

Subject: [Harbour] RON: Always having problem with VC++ and Simplex version
Message-ID: <200103212223.f2LMN8t16559@ev6.be.wanadoo.com>

Hi Ron,

I can't understand what could be wrong, but having (re) tryed many 
hours to fully recompile Harbour 0.36 with Simplex, I always have 
the same problem I was having with 0.35.

I can compile Harbour.exe bich correctly indicate 0.36 (Simplex) 
but this version seem to loop on some Prg, rendereing the Lib 
creation impossible (Ctrl-C is the only way to abort the looping). 
The BC 5.5 version (Simplex) as the VC++ Flex are perfectly 
working here. I don't see any debug action I could try. If you want, I 
cant send you the Bad Harbour.exe and even as many exe as you 
could need (with traces or wathever you could need) to you by 
direct E-mail.

Just for Info, this is my what my VC++ compiler say when running.

(Hi John, :), wich is your version ? )
Any other guy using VC++ and Simplex lexer ?

See you all,

Hello J.F.,

Attached is a zip file with my hb_slex.vc and the resulting make_vc.log.
Please compare with your make_vc.log.

As you can see from the LOG file, I had no problem building VC++ SimpLex
build.

Can you please try with the attached make file and let me know?

Please note, I used:

----------
Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 13.00.9030 for 80x86
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1984-2000. All rights reserved.

usage: cl [ option... ] filename... [ /link linkoption... ]
----------

and

----------
Microsoft (R) Macro Assembler Version 6.15.9030
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1981-2000.  All rights reserved.

usage: ML [ options ] filelist [ /link linkoptions]
Run "ML /help" or "ML /?" for more info
----------

You might have to change AS (line 86) from ML to MASM and check this line
(594):

$(AS) /c /Fo$@ $<

If you still fail, I will suggest you try UNCOMMENTing lines (30-31) in
harbour.slx:

//#define SHOW_LEX_TOKENS
//#define DEBUG_LEX

This will generate TRACE info from Lexer, that might explain your problem.

You'd have to look through your headers to see if your mail is 
routed through AOL somewhere before you would know. There is 
lots of peering going on right now...  

I'm beginning to think that in todays climate, we'd be better off if we 
made the replyto address of our list harbour@matrixlist.com and 
that way, things would trace, reverse lookups to the PTR record 
would work, etc.

It's really simple for me to change this. It wouldn't effect anything 
negatively (except the image that our list belongs to our domain).

Everyone's opinion?

I don't see how we can avoid moving to the matrixlist address for the
reply-to. I just privately routed to you a bounce that I got trying to
reply to this message at the original harbour@lists.harbour-project.org
address. I manually set the address on this reply by copying and pasting
the harbour@matrixlist.com address from your message.

Message-ID: <3ABAB271.28715.4D7089AE@localhost>

Because of mail filtering policies in place around the world today, it 
becomes increasingly important to have an address that will do a 
reverse lookup.  

lists.harbour-project.org does not, and was an alias for 
matrixlist.com, which will do reverse lookups.  

Therefore I have changed this mailing list replyto address to  

harbour@matrixlist.com as of today.

The messages that did not com thrue, are they "lost"?
If so, maybe we can repost our messages from the last 14 days?

Inbound messages that were not delivered to the mailing list are 
either lost or denied delivery.

Messages that made it to the list but didn't get distributed to 
everyone are available in the archives.

Let's all review the archives for the last two weeks, post anything 
that's obviously missing and move on.

I added support for passing the variable number of Arguments of an Error
operations. You should review classes.c and decides which arguments to pass
for the different errors.

So just search for RT_BASE and simply change the ", 0 )" to ",N ,Arg1, ...,
ArgN )", when needed.


BTW, did you get my reply about SimpLex and VC++?

Hi Ron,

It always does'nt work :-(((

hb_slex.vc is the same as your.

My log is the same as you but some Warning about unreferenced 
local var (within rdd)

The only difference I see is that you use a more recent cl.exe. Is it 
from
the new visual studio.net (7.X) product ? I reinstalled Visual studio 
6.0
+ svp4 keeping the same release. I don't want to install Beta on this
computer up to now (I'm MSDN universal subscriber so I should have
somewhere the same compiler as you)

Then I create a debug version of harbour and only finded it is 
looping at the end of some prg (the first one is rddord.prg) with the
following sentence just before the loop and a very strange error message.

***NEW LINE 75

   DELIMITER = "&"

then ... looping on ...  returning 38

ps: rddord.prg has only 76 lines ...


So, if you don't find a magic idea, I will try cl.exe 7.X this WE.

See you,

Hi Alex, (hope you are listening)

Any chance you can review the issues I reported regarding the lifetime and
release of MEMVARs?

TIA

Hi Ron,

Ok, it work now but seem slower than the Flex version. (Not the 
result program but Harbour itself)

I will have a more systematic try and let you know the result.

In all case, Thanks,

J.F.,

It is same speed as Flex build here.

Maybe you forgot to re-comment the tracing info?

Hi Ron

You where rigth, sorry, I forgot to remove the debug trace. :-(((((

Flex version take 2' 50'' to compile where Simplex one took only 2' 
30'' on my Athlon 800 (scsi disks) computer.

Good job.

Patrick,

Just a reminder, we still didn't hear from Jose about fixing the File
Handles issue. I think that we can release the quick 0.37 that Phil
suggested as soon as we solve this issue.

Subject: [Harbour] flock / append from/ Locate Errors
Message-ID: <001b01c0b58c$26c50970$921a5e18@bh>

In my fivewin app using rddads, an FLock() followed by APPEND FROM fails to
append any records.
I have not been able to duplicate this with a small pure Harbour prg.

Also, if I later do a LOCATE ... FOR ... on an empty file,
then close the app, the window closes, but the process is stuck running in
memory (using Win2K) and it starts using 98% of the cpu!

I'll keep you posted, but I just wanted to see if anyone else was finding
any strange results....?

Actually, that DNS entry still exists. The only problem appeared to 
be some black holing.

I'm just concerned that we have some orphans out there sending to

If DNS is back to rights there should be no problems. What problem is fixed
by replying to matrixlist.com?

Dave,

I for one, can't post to the old address, thus replying to older messages
result in returned un-deliverable messages. This is true since March 6th, 3
weeks ago.

I assume I'm not the only one, subject to this problem.

I have no problem, posting to harbour@matrixlist.com.

This therefore explains how to fix the problem of not being able to reply to
messages with the older address, as explained in the original message.

Where do you get these return messages from? What reason do they give for
the delivery failure?

This is my concern, we don't seem to be fixing anything. That is, sure,
replying to matrixlist.com is a useful short term method of getting email to
the list but it seems to me there's a deeper problem here. It might be worth
us getting to the bottom of that.

Are you able to see lists.harbour-project.org in any way at all?

Actually, traffic had dropped off well before the change and has
remained relatively constant since then, despite the change. (Well,
aside from today's traffic spike regarding why traffic is slow).

The deeper problem has already been explained by the owner of the
domains involved, in a message to the list with the subject "Re: What
happens?": "I'm beginning to think that in todays climate, we'd be
better off if we made the replyto address of our list
harbour@matrixlist.com and that way, things would trace, reverse lookups
to the PTR record would work, etc."

In other words, harbour@lists.harbour-project.org could not be traced
and reverse lookups on it would fail. This was causing some SMTP
servers, such as my ISP's SMTP server, to refuse to deliver mail to the
list. The following reason was given:

> ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
> harbour@lists.harbour-project.org
>     (reason: 553 sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed rcpthosts (#5.7.1))

What the message means is that my ISP's SMTP server couldn't do a
reverse lookup of the domain name in the delivery address and that the
domain name was not in its list of domains that don't require a reverse
lookup. This *is* the deeper problem that is being solved by changing
the return address for the list from one that can't be resolved via
reverse lookup to one that can...

Phil:
Some of the bugs I reported are fairly innocuous, but this one can affect a
lot of things:

------------------------------------------------------------------
Symbol searches fail if the symbol has trailing spaces.
   For example,
      use test alias test
      // this would be cVar's value if read from a dbf field
      cVar := "TEST      "
      select(cVar)  --> returns 0
   The discussion on this centered on a desire to not slow down all symbol
   handling (the bug is not only in the select function)
------------------------------------------------------------------

I also have a standing question re SetScope which only Alexander replied to,
but I can make the change if we agree:  The problem is numeric Scopes fail.
My proposed fix is that the scope be passed to SELF_ as the original Item
for parsing, whereas now it is checked in ordScope and only the value is
passed.

Should we send down the item instead??

This is the conversation your smart host had with Phil's machine. It's the
SMTP server of matrixlist.com that is refusing to accept your email. This
looks like a configuration problem over on Phil's machine.

Further to my other reply, and after seeing Ron's bounce, what does the
bugger picture of what you quote here look like? It looks similar to Ron's
bounce but if you look at Ron's you'll see that the complaint isn't about
lists.harbour-project.org, the complaint is *from* lists.harbour-project.org
(or, more to the point, the machine that handles email for it).

Curious. Ron got the same message as you but it would appear for totally
different reasons. Is that really the case?

I'm still not clear why matrixlist.com is seen as "good" but harbour's lists
"host" is seen as bad.

This is what I'm pondering, what is "traced" and why can't it work?

Doesn't this simply suggest that there's some incorrect DNS information out
there? Why does your ISP think that lists.harbour-project.org is a problem?
Why can't that problem be fixed?

David, if you're reading this, can you double check your reading of the
bounce message you got? I suspect you might have misread what it was telling
you.

Phil, if you're reading this, why is the machine that is the mail host for
lists.harbour-project.org refusing mail for lists.harbour-project.org? Is
this simply a postfix configuration error? Do your admin logs show any
changes to the postfix configuration on or about the time that people
reported the current mail problems?

The error codes and messages are identical. In my message I listed my
interpretation of said error message, which differs from your

No, because my ISP's SMTP server was able to talk to the matrixlist
SMTP server.

Because the matrixlist.com SMTP server told my ISP's SMTP server that
it was a problem.

Because the problem is not at my ISP's end of the pipe.

Probably because 'nslookup matrixlist.com' succeeds, but 'nslookup
lists.harbour-project.org' fails, which either has to do with the type
of record needed to do a mail map of lists.harbour-project.org to
matrixlist.com, or is because the mapping has been removed. Either way,
matrixlist.com is the domain that actually manages all of the Harbour
mailing lists and it is more reliable to deal directly with the final
domain than to deal with a domain that is mail mapped. Don't ask *me*
why, because I don't know. But people that I trust that do mail hosting
have told me that certain types of mail mapping DNS records can be
problematic.

I wasn't asking if you or your ISP could fix the problem, I was asking about
the problem in general.

'nslookup davep.org' "fails" for various values of fails too, as will
nslookup on *many* domains. I'm not aware that people are unable to send me
email though.

Moreover, this explanation doesn't make sense as you seem to be suggesting
that there might be a DNS problem but elsewhere you seem to be suggesting
(as I discovered) the cause of the bounce messages is "taz2".

What I don't follow about your explanation is that you seem to suggest that
it is some form of DNS thing. However, if the message you received was
identical to Ron's I don't see how it could be a DNS thing, at least not
"out here". The error message came from Phil's machine, nowhere else.

But as I've just demonstrated, the error message is coming from Phil's
machine. not from anyone's "SMTP server" (AKA SMTP relay AKA smart host).
Your reading of it said:

,----
| What the message means is that my ISP's SMTP server couldn't do a
| reverse lookup of the domain name in the delivery address and that the
| domain name was not in its list of domains that don't require a reverse
| lookup.
`----

As you'll have seen from my test, which generated exactly the same error, no
ISP SMTP servers were involved, only Phil's machine. Also, as you'll see
from Ron's bounce message, the error was generated by Phil's machine, not by
his ISP's SMTP server.

If you doubt your reading of the error is wrong would you be so kind as to
show how my tests demonstrate that it's a reverse DNS lookup problem
involving an SMTP relay?

Right, that's one apology due to misreading that I owe you now. I didn't see
the "don't" in the above. ;>

As an aside, and to atone for my misreading <g>, I've been doing some more
hunting and found <URL:http://www.palomine.net/qmail/relaying.html> (Phil
appears to be using qmail these days, I thought he was a postfix user).

It would appear that for some reason Phil's machine has decided to refuse to
do relaying for all of us when we want to send mail to lists.h-p.org.
Possible further evidence that this is the case is:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~$ ssh oasis
| Last login: Tue Mar 27 14:34:35 2001 from hagbard.demon.co.uk
|
| davep@taz2:~$ telnet 0 smtp

| rcpt to: <harbour@lists.harbour-project.org>
| 250 ok
| quit
| 221 taz2.fiberhosting.com
| Connection closed by foreign host.
`----

The evidence here been that taz2's SMTP server is happy to accept mail for
lists.h-p.org from within Phil's universe, but not from without.

And, unless I'm mistaken, that is the cause of the problem:

No problems here. Are you in a position to check that your DNS servers know
about www.harbour-project.org and friends and what it thinks they are?

That's not what I meant. You wrote, "I suspect you might have misread
what it was telling you," to which I replied, "I don't doubt that at
all." (In other words, I wouldn't be surprised if I did misread what the
bounce was telling me.)

It is named that for good reason!

You thought that Phil was running Postfix, but he turned out to be
running Qmail. Is it possible that he used to run Postfix, which accepts
domains, and that the problems started when he switched to Qmail, which
requires hosts?

Subject: [Harbour] 'contrib' app hooks into harbour
Message-ID: <3AC12610.99C6D496@mail.rosecom.ca>

I've been hitting my head with an indeterminant bug in the btree contrib
I want to make.

But that is not the issue of this email...

If a contrib needs some early initialization or termination cleanup, how
would a contrib .lib/.o do it?

When I adapted the setkey code to .c, someone suggested that I add a
call to the init & term inside one of the harbour vm files, and this
worked well... for setkey.

I know that a .prg-based contrib can use init/term procedures, but is
there any means to identify a .c file as such?

(if this has been discussed or covered, my apologies :-)

I don't recall this having been discussed, but one way to do it would
be to look at the generated C source code for a program file that uses
INIT PROC and then reduce that to the minimum code needed. I did that
just now and came up with the following code skeleton:

/*
 * Harbour Compiler, 0.36  (Build 36) (2001.02.20) (Flex)
 * Generated C source code
 */

#include "hbvmpub.h"
#include "hbinit.h"


static HB_FUNC( STARTUP );


HB_INIT_SYMBOLS_BEGIN( hb_vm_SymbolInit_T )
{ "STARTUP", HB_FS_INIT | HB_FS_FIRST, HB_FUNCNAME( STARTUP ), NULL },
HB_INIT_SYMBOLS_END( hb_vm_SymbolInit_T )
#if defined(_MSC_VER)
   #if _MSC_VER >= 1010
      #pragma data_seg( ".CRT$XIY" )
      #pragma comment( linker, "/Merge:.CRT=.data" )
   #else
      #pragma data_seg( "XIY" )
   #endif
   static HB_$INITSYM hb_vm_auto_SymbolInit_T = hb_vm_SymbolInit_T;
   #pragma data_seg()
#elif ! defined(__GNUC__)
   #pragma startup hb_vm_SymbolInit_T
#endif

static HB_FUNC( STARTUP )
{
   /* This is where the generated PCode would normally be,
      followed by a call to the virtual machine runtime,
      but you can put whatever you want in here. */
}

I switched from postfix last summer, when I installed the new 
machine.

The only thing that changed around this time is that thousands of 
machines changed their DNS version to avoid being exploited.

It is my opinion that several mail systems started rejecting mail for 
addresses that were indirect.

I updated my DNS on or about that time, but the basic DNS 
configuration records didn't change at all.

I heard that lots of other mailing lists that were doing MX redirection 
were also having problems.

That is why I suggested going to the direct address.

Ok, try it now. I wonder if this was a side effect of a new version of 
Bind?

I think a couple of replies stated that they thought that would be

David/April,

That standard set-up & init stuff looks like it should be a #include.
Putting it into one's own C file(s) is going to add to the maintenance
load (as well as being _so_ ugly).

Never having seen postfix I don't know what the configuration files look
like so I don't know if they are "shared" with qmail (not Qmail, the author
seems particular about the spelling) in any way.

I hope this doesn't mean that my apology didn't make it thru the list (he

That was the cause of the problem, nothing to do with DNS at all:

You should be able to safely switch back to lists.harbour-project.org now.

What ever you did, I didn't get a bounce this time, but...

I can't see my message, and on the web page I see your reply to Brian about
0.37 which I didn't receive either.

Dave,

Good detective work!

As you can see my message to harbour@lists.harbour-project.org got through
after Phil's latest change.

Eventually. Seems that the list has been constipated today. At least, that's
my reading of the fact that a bunch of emails I sent first thing this
morning (UK local time) just turned up (early evening, UK local time).

As an example, here's the mailhop history for one message I sent that was
delayed (and wasn't visible in the archives either, but is now):

The sticking point appears to have been ns.dios.net. Anyone know who or what
dios.net are/is (well, I can guess what it is from the host name but I'm
wondering what it is in it's role as a mail relay)? I don't believe that it
has anything to do with mail routing to davep.org so that would suggest that
it has something to do with taz.fiberhosting.com (Phil's machine).

Pah! I wasn't thinking. traceroute is my friend:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~$ traceroute matrixlist.com | tail -2
| 12  GTW002e0.BLT.MD.dios.net (208.178.160.2)   [SNIP]
| 13  taz.fiberhosting.com (206.132.232.90)  [SNIP]
`----

So I'm guessing that *.dios.net is where Phil's machine is located and that
ns.dios.net is some mail relay for Phil's machine and it decided to hold
onto some messages for upwards of nine hours.

I only have access of DJGPP, but would not some parts of the init/term
procs be compiler dependant?

Dave, can you send me the .prg you built your example from?  OR maybe I'll
write one and get other team members to compile with assorted compilers
and send me the source code...

It is way to early for me to think at all, so...

I have contacted Jose about this, but he is very limited in resources now...
He has promised he will look at it when he finds some more time.

Harbour does *not* generate different C code based on what compiler you
used to create Harbour. All of the dependencies are in the two include
files and in the generated C code.

Having people send you the generated C code from various Harbour
compilers would just be a waste of everybody's time...

Hi,

I go for a 2 weeks vacation.  I have yesterday unsubscribed (my mailbox size
is small) but it apparetly did not happen.  Could someone unsubscribe me?  I
mean it is no problem for me that mails come but the list server might hate
when it will get the mailbox is full messages back! :-((

BTW, I have got the info (on the website, when unsibscribing) that it was
done.  So something must be wrong, since I have received about 8 mails
today.

Thank you for politely pointing out my mistake.  I had believed that a harbour
produced with a C compiler would generate C code particular to that
compiler.

> Having people send you the generated C code from various Harbour
> compilers would just be a waste of everybody's time...

Again you are correct.  I have been experimenting with a small include
file, but I could use some pre-processor advice.

I know I cannot use a macro expansion - the macro would contain preprocessor
directives.

I have been experimenting with defining three values: init proc name, exit
proc name, and the c file name, and then including the .h file.  This has been
working fine except that :

#define THB_FUNC( n ) HB_FUNC( n )
#define THB_FUNCNAME( n ) HB_FUNCNAME(n)

#define ASSTRING( n ) n

#define SYMBOLNAME( n ) hb_vm_SymbolInit_##n
#define AUTOSYMBOLNAME( n ) hb_vm_auto_SymbolInit_##n

HB_INIT_SYMBOLS_BEGIN(SYMBOLNAME(INITCNAME))
{ ASSTRING( INITNAME ), HB_FS_INIT, THB_FUNCNAME( INITNAME ), NULL },
{ ASSTRING( EXITNAME ), HB_FS_EXIT, THB_FUNCNAME( EXITNAME ), NULL }
HB_INIT_SYMBOLS_END(SYMBOLNAME(INITCNAME))

becomes:

static HB_SYMB symbols[] = {
{   first    , ( ( HB_SYMBOLSCOPE ) 0x08 ) , HB_FUN_first      , 0  },
{   second    , ( ( HB_SYMBOLSCOPE ) 0x10 ) , HB_FUN_second      , 0  }
}; static void __attribute__ ((constructor))  hb_vm_SymbolInit_INITCNAME   (
void ) { hb_vmProcessSymbols( symbols, sizeof( symbols ) / sizeof( HB_SYMB ) );
}

all of the elements are preprocessed properly except the first element of the
array structurs: it should have quotes around the names 'first' and 'second'

If I change:
#define ASSTRING( n ) n
to
#define ASSTRING( n ) #n

static HB_SYMB symbols[] = {
{ "INITNAME" , ( ( HB_SYMBOLSCOPE ) 0x08 ) , HB_FUN_first      , 0  },
{ "EXITNAME" , ( ( HB_SYMBOLSCOPE ) 0x10 ) , HB_FUN_second      , 0  }
};

I guess since the init/exit procs cannot be called directly, would there be any
problem with this field of the structure being a constant value?

Sincerly,

April

 I want to do few fixes and additions in dbfntx before.
 Don't sure that I'll have enough time for it next few days, but I'll
 try.

Alexander,

Thanks a lot for your work on DBFNTX.

Just a question, does it have memo support yet ?

 Antonio,

 Support of dbt memo files is included in dbf layer ( dbf1.c ) - and
 this isn't right, I think, it should be in dbfntx layer.
 But I never checked, how it works and what stage of completion is it.

Ron (or/and anyone with spare time )

I fixed the FRead problem (it was actually a FOpen problem), but doing that
I discovered other problems with the win32 routines (especially error
checking).
I fixed them: (hb_fsClose, hb_fsRead, hb_fsWrite, hb_fsReadLarge,
hb_fsWriteLarge, hb_fsSeek, hb_fsTell).

Many filesys.c routines works with handles but they didn't had support for
win32, so they failed as it seems that the "normal" handles (eg: open() )
are not compatible with the ones from the win32 api (Createfile).
I added support for: hb_fsEof , hb_fsCommit, hb_fsLock, convert_seek_flags.

I don't cvs'ed the file because of two reasons:
- asking for testing (the file is attached)
- there is still potencial incompatibilities with handles not created with
hb_fsOpen (I found them in console.c at least)

I was wondering to flag the handles opened with the win32 api in order to
keep compatibility with the normal handles. That mark would be a 0x4000:
if  ( (handle & 0xC000) == 0x4000)
  handle_win32 = handle & 0x3FFF; // and routines for win32
else
  // normal routines from C compiler

This should work (unless windows uses a file handle in that range!)
I would like to hear opinions !

Horacio

You need to use two levels of macros:

/* t1.c */

#define INITCNAME Z
#define INITNAME first
#define EXITNAME last

#include "t1.h"

/* t1.h */

Horacio:
Thanks for the work on the FS functions!
The main issue I saw (did you see my msg a few weeks ago with several "bug"
reports?) was the compatibility of existing code that uses "clipper" fs
calls for normal handles.

With your proposal, would such code have to be changed to work?  For
example, memoline/mlcount were failing, but also there is also existing
extend system code written by app developers that we probably want to stay
syntactically consistent with.  Are we able to replace all the file system
calls a programmer may have made using a normal handle?

Optimally, Harbour routines would work with the new Handles transparently,
but without removing the ability to use normal handles unless we can also
transparently alter all usage, which seems unlikely.
It just occurred to me that perhaps the Harbour rtl could use one more level
of indirection (perhaps a set of macros) so that the RDD and other routines
could be using the new Handles but the fs* functions themselves would still
use old handles by default ??

I'll take a good look at your post this weekend....

Brian

Yes, I know. It's not a final idea.
I remember having read that Windows error (from GetLastError) codes reserved
a bit (I don't remeber if it was 29 or 30) to mark applications defined
error codes.
So I was wondering if there were some numbers not used by Windows for
handles in the same way.
I don't know this, I just dropped an idea because someone could have a hint
on that.

If that it's not possible, I think we should mantain compatibility with the
fsX function on normal "C" handles and have a different set used of routines
platform especific and #defines for improving performance.

The compatibility using the same set of routines could be achieved if
internally in Harbour we could have extra space for marking a Win32 handle.

If Harbour FHANLDE could have space to store the type of handle plus the
hanlde itself it is easy to do the task.
The problem is that the size of a Win32 handle is 4 bytes (it is defined as
a void* ). Have you any ideas on this?

If this is not possible, the idea to have a separate set of functions with
macros to activate them on compile should work fine .

> Are we able to replace all the file system
> calls a programmer may have made using a normal handle?
The functions that receive a handle and aren't Win32 compatible yet are:
hb_fsIsDevice, hb_fsSetDevMode.
The others unchanged functions in filesys do not use a handle and could be
changed later or not.

Yes, it is possible.

I am working with Slang 1.4.4 localy and I have them defined in slang.h.
This is why I enabled them in current version of gtsln. Previously they were 
marked as a comment. I did not try to compile it with previous versions of 
Slang (sorry, my error) but I've checked this and at least they are defined 
in Slang 1.4.1. Unfortunately I can not check previous versions because 
I've simply removed them (I consider them as old versions).
So I suppose You are using a Slang version prior to 1.4.1

A simple fix, which should be enough, is below :
( replace lines in  gtsln from line 1030 to 1043
  or simply add a conditional directive )

------------------ cut ----------------------------

#if SLANG_VERSION > 10400     /* this is a new line which should be added */
            case SLSMG_DIAMOND_CHAR :  s_convHighChars[ 04 ] = SLch;
                                       break;
            case SLSMG_LARROW_CHAR  :  s_convHighChars[ 17 ] = SLch;
                                       s_convHighChars[ 27 ] = SLch;
                                       break;
            case SLSMG_RARROW_CHAR  :  s_convHighChars[ 16 ] = SLch;
                                       s_convHighChars[ 26 ] = SLch;
                                       break;
            case SLSMG_DARROW_CHAR  :  s_convHighChars[ 25 ] = SLch;
                                       s_convHighChars[ 31 ] = SLch;
                                       break;

Our large Harbour/FW app intermittently gpfs.  When it does, we only get
data on the secondary errors that follow.  The result for the user is a
msgbox that shows an "impossible" stack call list.  In one example, our
public variable that maintains the main frame window object is replaced by
another object, so in
    oMainWnd:MainWndIvar
The error reported is
    SomeOtherObject:MainWndIvar --- Message Not Found

Another example is that, instead of a window object being correctly pulled
out of an array of objects, some other object gets sent the message:
    SomeOtherObject:HandleEvent() --- Message Not Found

What's worse is the app window closes after the msgbox is closed, but a
process is left running in the background eating cpu cycles.  This is of
course unacceptable error handling for me to give to my clients, especially
since WIn98 has no way to clear that process without rebooting.

We are doing everything we can to isolate what may lead to this memory
corruption -- more on this later.

But does anyone have any ideas how to trap and clean up the errors
effectively?  What can we do to be sure that at least the app fully unloads
from memory?  Any tips on how the error system could reveal the primary
errors earlier?  What code could I add to the vm or class source allow us to
trace back and identify the memory errors?

Thank you David for the help.  I thought is was two levels of macros, but
never quite got it right.

Before I go further, I'd like a suggestion on a destination for such a
file.

I don't think that it should go into the normal include dir.
I know that there is a contrib dir, but there is also a source\contrib.
What is the intent of this second dir?

I  can see this file going into one of:
- include
- include\contrib
- contrib\include
- source\contrib\include

I understand that the creation of directories has to be considered
carefully because the removal of them is extremely difficult, so I would
like - heck: need - expert opinions.

p..s. if someone could just help with the bug in my btree code :-)

Subject: [Harbour] init & exit procs...
Message-ID: <3AC6AD12.2F337392@mail.rosecom.ca>

I've been playing a bit more with init/exit within C, but I do have a
question or two about prgs:

1.  there is a symbol HB_FS_INITEXIT (hbvmpub.h), but a small note in
genc.c states:
"Since the normal function cannot be INIT and EXIT at the same time
 we are using these two bits to mark the special function used to
 initialize static variables"

    - is this really a bad thing?  could not a hand-created init c
      routine not also be defined as a exit routine?  ie. if the 
      static control var is zero this must be init, else exit

2. are init/term procs in the symbol table?  They might be since there
is a call to hb_vmProcessSymbols() with the proc symbols.  I tried a 
'static init' proc test and received a compiler warning for my troubles.

3. Is there a need for the hb_vm_auto_SymbolInit_*** symbol to be
unique? As far as I can tell, it is created from the source filename 
for a static constructor function.  Might it be enough to merge the 
name of the init and exit procs together?  I am looking at this as 
a means to replace the third #define needed to create a unique 
hb_vm_auto_SymbolInit_*** symbol name.

Thanks.
