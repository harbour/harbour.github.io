I think this is a question for users lists.


hbmk2 <Enter> you can see the usage of hbmk2

create an .hbp  file that contains.

-hblib creates static library
-o output file name.

and following list all the files that take part of the library

Then create another hpb that contains
-L the path where you put the above library
-l the name of the library
follow the  list of prgs that you wish to include in your exe but do not 
take part of the library

If you download the sources of harbour you can see the examples how to 
build with hbmk2.

I do not know if this is the best way to do it, but it works for me.


Best regards

Maurizio

Subject: [Harbour-users] DBF Fast text search / SQLite
Message-ID: <A24108F4B3F74E8185F84E9E6C092B4C@SUPPORTS>

Hello,

    What is the best way to do a full text search in various fields of a DBF file?
    Seems that RDD Six for Clipper has HS_Index() / HS_Filter() and so that are really fast but what is best option in Harbour since AFAIK DBRMAP is not available? 
    Below an example in the xHarbour Language Reference Guide that may be a good option but it is not "that" fast when the database is big.
    Any ideas of how to do it in a optimized way it with DBF file, maybe including many fields and a memo field, too?
    By the way... I do not have any experience with SQL but I belive this operation could be done easily with RDBMS. It is a good idea to bring an exemple of it too, if possible, just to compare a bit the available options.
    I am thinking about using SQLite to enter in the SQL world because it seems to be easier to intall and configure what is other situation for PostgreSQL and others. As they say in their website:

SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain

    Seems very interesting. Does anyone know if this SQLite could be used with Harbour for a serious application (by serious I mean, trustyworth and with enough resources to do the common commercial application's transactions and operations).
    Unfortunatelly DBF seems to be easy to corrupt due to hardware failures / power source / crashs / cables, etc.. and in real life applications it is not admissible to loose or corrupt data.
    Does anyone uses SQLite with Harbour?

    Any comments are welcome.
    Thanks for any help.

A fast and realiable serverless SQL engine would be really something to 
business applications, but according to SQLite documentation 
(http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.htm) SQLite is not really designed for 
shared access because "SQLite uses reader/writer locks on the entire 
database file".
I dont really know hbnetio, but maybe SQLite could be shared across LAN 
trough an hbnetio server. Can someone (who knows better hbnetio) tell if 
this approach is applicable?

I posted on the developers list a few day ago about BerkelyDB from Oracle 
(originally from Sleepy Cat software) which can now use the SQLite API to supply 
a full DBMS system. BerkelyDB seems well regarded, I have no personal 
experience. Google for more info

Leandro,

    Your idea of using HBNETIO seems interesting but will require more
experienced users to comment about it.
    Right now I just use simple DBF/CDX/FTP but I want to convert a simple
system to SQLite to learn a bit about SQL sintax and design.
    A serveless SQL database is what I need right now. I need something
simple and easy to start. According to what I could understand using SQLite
instead of DBF will result in a more stable and secure program that means
less data corruption or maybe no corruption. Data loss is inadmissible in
real life applications!
    I understand that SQLite is not designed for shared access but maybe for
2-12 concurrent connections it will be good enough and right now I'm not
planning to use it for more than that. Maybe in a future development I could
switch to PostgreSQL for a more powerfull and SECURE application or maybe to
BerkleyDB from Oracle according to the news Alex Strickland shared with us.

    Wikipedia's: "Berkeley DB (BDB) is a computer software library that
provides a high-performance embedded database, with bindings in C, C++,
Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Smalltalk, and other programming languages.
BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports multiple
data items for a single key. BDB can support thousands of simultaneous
threads of control or concurrent processes manipulating databases as large
as 256 terabytes, on a wide variety of operating systems including most
Unix-like and Windows systems, and real-time operating systems."

http://www.oracle.com/database/docs/berkeley-db-datasheet.pdf

    The goal right now is  to jump quickly to something better and more
reliable than DBF and I need information and shared experience from others
to do the right choice. Maybe SQLite is not the right option and would not
be worthy of my efforts to learn, maybe I should jump to PostgreSQL (or
other).

SQLite's features http://www.sqlite.org/features.html:
*.. Transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) even
after system crashes and power failures.
*.. Zero-configuration - no setup or administration needed.
*.. Implements most of SQL92. (Features not supported)
*.. A complete database is stored in a single cross-platform disk file.
*.. Supports terabyte-sized databases and gigabyte-sized strings and blobs.
(See limits.html.)
*.. Small code footprint: less than 300KiB fully configured or less than
180KiB with optional features omitted.
*.. Faster than popular client/server database engines for most common
operations.
*.. Simple, easy to use API.
*.. Written in ANSI-C. TCL bindings included. Bindings for dozens of other
languages available separately.
*.. Well-commented source code with 100% branch test coverage.
*.. Available as a single ANSI-C source-code file that you can easily drop
into another project.
*.. Self-contained: no external dependencies.
*.. Cross-platform: Unix (Linux and Mac OS X), OS/2, and Windows (Win32 and
WinCE) are supported out of the box. Easy to port to other systems.
*.. Sources are in the public domain. Use for any purpose.
*.. Comes with a standalone command-line interface (CLI) client that can be
used to administer SQLite databases.

    Please any advise is welcome.

You are making false assertions ...

1) DBF and Sqlite are just file formats.
2) DBFs are not unstable per se. Is hardware failures and the need for a 
connections to be kept alive that makes them more prone to be affected 
by hardware errors.
3) SQL is a query languaje. It adds nothing to solve your hardawre 
unstability.
4) Only client-server paradigm helps to minimize hardware failures.
5) SQlite suffres from the same exposure than a DBF if handled in a LAN 
with multiple users.

Try to reconstruct a postgresql o sqlite corrupted by hand with a simple 
text editor. No Way.
The same operation is very possible over a corrupted dbf file !

Hello Angel,

    Sorry, I don't have any experience with any other database that is not
DBF.
    I really appreciate to be corrected but I don't think I am making false
assertions.
    I agree with you that the DBF isn't instable per se and that the problem
is hardware failure but I can't expect the hardware to be working well all
the time. I actually expect many problems, hardware crashes, user mistakes,
etc... this is the real life application and DBF is not prepared to deal
with such problems. In my experience I have problems with data loss, data
corruption.
    SQLite is not a DBMS like others, it is much smaller and "lite" but it
considers that problems and do something about it. Please read this article
from their website: http://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html Here explains in
details what SQLite tries to do to avoid data corruption / data loss. At
least makes sense to me and seems better than what a DBF would do.
    This is why I believe (in theory) SQLite is more reliable than DBF
approach. Am I wrong in my assumptions? I am not making any assertions here,
just to make it clear, please.
    I have to consider also that it is clearly possible to corrupt a SQLite
database.
    Please look this: http://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#how_to_corrupt
    I belive a problem could happen to the best DBMS. Can you imagine a
fatal burn HD? Actually any DBMS can loose data due to bad hardware or
right combination of failures, even human failure.
    Seems to me that using a client/server database like PostgreSQL would be
a "too complex" task for a smaller application due to it's installation
process and configuration. IMHO it would be too onerous to maintain small
applications and very simple maintenance + more reliable database than DBF
are my goals. Other consideration is that I can't spend money with a "good"
DBMS. Maybe the maximum I could use would be PostgreSQL.
    Firebird seems to be good but not as PostgreSQL, same for MySQL and
BerkeleyDB. Correct me if I am wrong.
    What do you think? I appreciate your response and any comments. I am
looking for help.
    Other thing: I like the SQLite website because they open the information
to the users and it gives more confidence that someone did and is doing a
serious job. Look this information, please:
http://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html
    There is also a interesting discussion about SQLite inexistent 
replication feature here:
http://old.nabble.com/Sqlite-replication-td20959033.html
    My main question is: Is advantage to move from DBF to SQLite in terms of
protecting your data from corruption and data loss? At least minimizing it?
    I understand that backup is essencial to avoid loosing all your data and
that it is possible to loose data with the best DBMS available.
    Others are welcome to this nice discussion, please
    Regards,

Qatan

There's only 2 options (mostly)

1) peer to peer acces. Either DBF or SQLite. Corruption expure is the same

2) Client server access. Here you divide your corruption risk between
client machines and your server.

That's it !

NetIO allows you to work in mode 1, or in mode 2 if using RPC and you 
split your program logic.

Changing DBF in favour of SQlite, changes nothing if avoiding corruption 
is your goal.

Sqlite has other advantages like multi languaje support, faster access, 
easier querying method. But it has nothing to do with corruption risks.

Operator LIKE is intentionally not supported because using identifiers
like IN, LIKE, HAS, ... as operators breaks PP operator precedence
rules so it cannot be introduced without breaking Clipper compatibility.
It means that we do not plan to ever make it.
You can use:

   HB_REGEXLIKE( <cRegEx>, <cString> )

which gives exactly the same functionality.
I suggest you to look at contrib/xhb/hbcompat.ch.
You will find some preprocessor rules which tries to hide some
differences between Harbour and xHarbour, i.e.
   ( <cString> LIKE <cRegEx> )
(expression in parenthesis) is automatically translated to:
   HB_REGEXLIKE( <cRegEx>, <cString> )

    Faster access, easy querying method and the opportunity to learn SQL 
without the trouble of setting up an server and administer that are 
sufficient arguments for me to be encouraged about at least try SQLite.
    I was reading the SQLite docs and I was impressed by the possibilities 
but I will have to test it to know the reality of all that.
    I'm a bit surprised because I was expecting something even simpler from 
SQLite but seems that there is no way to do anything in SQL without sweating 
the brow. I am trying to do a very simple application but it is not that 
easy yet for me... I just want to create/open a DB, search for records, add 
more, edit some, delete some, do some searches, show data on screen and 
print, this is mostly what a common database application would do - seems 
pretty simple (in DBF terms) but in SQLite is a challenge for me since I am 
not familiar with SQL culture and syntax.
    I plan to switch to something more robust like PostgreSQL / MySQL / 
Firebird that will minimize the corruption problems but seems to be a long 
journey yet.
    SQLite will be a good start. If I can do something useful with it I will 
certainly be able to start using PostgreSQL.
    Thanks for your help.
    Anyone's else comments are also very welcome!

    Regards,

Qatan

Hello Don Lowenstein,

    I think this is the same one I found in \examples\rddado of Harbour from 
SVN, right?
    I'm testing it to get information from a MDB access database from a old 
system my friend is using and needs some extra features like sending email 
automatically to the clients, etc...
    What is your experience with RDDADO? Seems interesting and simple but I 
heard it was not being updated anymore, maybe because it is stable. Do you 
anything about it that you could share with us?
    I tried also \contrib\hbodbc but didn't work (probably my fault).
    I am discovering the RDDSQL "SQLMIX". Seems interesting and easy to use. 
Do you know anything about it?
    Thanks for your suggestion.
    Regards,

Qatan

===================================================================
                     Simple SQL Interface for Harbour



1. Introduction

    Simple SQL interface implements accessing SQL query result via RDD
interface. It is not intended to be replacement for "transparent" move of
DBFCDX application to SQL world.

    I want to discuss this in more detail. Many current RDDs for SQL servers
(ex. SQLRDD from xHarbour.com) tries to make a feeling you are working with
DBF file, but not with SQL database. SQL server does not support many
features, ex. RECNO(), deleted flag, file locks, record locks. These RDDs
are emulating these features to make feeling of DBF. DELETED() function is
emulated by creating additional table columns to store delete flag. Some
"hidden system" tables are used to register locking operations and emulate
record and file locks in DBF style. The idea of SQL query is also lost. If
you do a simple loop

  DBUSEAREA(, "select * from my_table")
  DO WHILE ! EOF()
    somefunc( FIELD->some_sql_field )
    DBSKIP()
  ENDDO

RDD usualy will read SQL rows in portions, let's say 100 records per query.
So, hidden queries are generated. If you are using indexes these queries
are really complicated. Let's have index on FIELD1 + STR(FIELD2). A seek to
value cValue1 + STR(nValue2) will generate a query like:

  SELECT * FROM my_table
      WHERE (FIELD1 == cValue1 and FIELD2 >= nValue2) or FIELD1 > cValue1
      ORDER BY FIELD1, FIELD2, _RECNO
      LIMIT 100

After evaluation of first 100 cached records, next query will be generated:

  SELECT * FROM my_table
      WHERE (FIELD1 == cLastField1 and FIELD2 == nLastValue2 and
_RECNO > nLastRecno) or
            (FIELD1 == cLastField1 and FIELD2 > nLastValue2) or
            FIELD1 > cLastValue1
      ORDER BY FIELD1, FIELD2, _RECNO
      LIMIT 100

To optimize these queries the SQL index expresion should be
"FIELD1,FIELD2,_RECNO", but not "FIELD1,FIELD2" as written in INDEX ON
command.

    "Simple SQL interface" is too long to repeat every time I want to
address this library. I'll also use acronym "SSI" to address it.

    The idea of SSI is different. It does not make hidden queries. All
queries should be made explicitly by programmer. SSI gives access to query
result via RDD interface, it does not tries to emulate DBF and be
"plug-and-play" solution for DBF to SQL migration. If you do

  DBUSEAREA(, "select * from my_table")

all query (it could contain millions of records!) will be cached.

    The features of SSI approach are:

- It's possible to access SQL database of other applications. Other
  applications usualy does not follow agreement of "plug-and-play" SQL drivers
  about additional DELETED column, _RECNO in the end of index expression, etc.
  Access of SQL database of other applications is sometimes not possible.

- It's query oriented. That means a simple DO WHILE ! EOF() loop will iterate
  each records once and only once. This is not true for "plug-and-play" SQL
  drivers, if indexing is used. Just like in the case of loop over DBF file.
  It is not guaranteed that all records are included! Yes! If key value of the
  first record in index is changed to be the last record in index during the
  phase of record processing, DO WHILE ! EOF() loop will iterate only this
  single records even if the database contains millions of records. Your sould
  do FLOCK() on DBF to guarantee the records are not changed. Do you use FLOCK()
  before readonly DO WHILE ! EOF() loops? :)



2. Architecture


              +-------------+
              |             |
              | SQLMIX RDD  |
              |             |
              +-------------+
                   |  ^
                   V  |
              +-------------+    +---------+
              |             |--->|         |
              | SQLBASE RDD |    |   SDD   |
              |             |<---|         |
              +-------------+    +---------+


    SQLBASE RDD implements basic functionality for accessing SQL query result
via RDD interface. This RDD could be used, if indexing of query result is not
necessary or all indexing is done by SQL server (by using ORDER BY clause).

    SQLMIX RDD implements indexing of query result. This indexing is not
related to SQL server ORDER BY clause. SQLMIX do indexing of the query on the
client side.

    SDD is acronym for Sql Database Driver. RDD is used to implement access
of different database formats like DBF, SDF, etc. SDD is used to implement
access of different SQL databases. Every SQL server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
has a corresponding SDD. SDD driver implements a specific part of data
exchange interface between SQLBASE and SQL server.

    A few additional functions are also implemented, ex. HB_SQLCONNECT().
Usualy these functions are just a shorter version of corresponding RDDINFO()
call.



3. Modifying database

    SSI presents a query result via RDD interface and generates no hidden
SQL queries. So, how database can be changed? Does DBAPPEND() and FIELDPUT()
works, or is it readonly SQL interface?
    DBAPPEND(), FIELDPUT() and other similiar functions work on cached query
result, i.e. query can be appended by new rows and field values can be
changed, but SQL database is not changed. DBCREATE() function can also be
used to create an "empty query result" but no table is created on SQL server.
So, SSI can also be used as implementation of "array RDD".
    The programmer must call SQL command explicitly to modify SQL tables.
SSI provides a method to detect which cached rows was changed or appended.

Hello Massimo,

    Thanks for helping.
    Do you have experience using RDDSQL?
    Seems very good but I am afraid I didn't understand part 3, maybe a good 
example would be the answer for that. How can I save the modifications?
    Regards,

Qatan

Hello Massimo,

    Good example, but I don't have MySQL installed and can't test it.
    Does anyone has MySQL installed and harbour from SVN built with 
HB_WITH_MYSQL set? Could you please test the example?
    What I am trying to see is the REPLACE command working. According to 
what I could understand it will not save the records on the server side, 
only on cached query result but SQL database is not changed.

    "The programmer must call SQL command explicitly to modify SQL tables.
SSI provides a method to detect which cached rows was changed or appended."

    I would like to see it in a example, please.

    Thanks

Hi!

How to work with field auto increment ? For example:

aStru := {{'codcli','+',04,0},;
           {'nome'  ,'c',40,0}}

create file cliente.dbf

bStru := {{'codcli','n',10,0},;
	   ...
create file sum.dbf

To the case create relation into aStru and bStru ?

Best regards,
Itamar M. Lins Jr.

Hello Massimo,

    Thanks for testing.
    This is what I was expecting.
    I am studing SQLite a bit and plan to use it because of it's easy 
instalation and "simple" use.
    I mean "simple" compared to other SQL solutions but for me it is a new 
thing yet and I will have much to learn.
    When I have SQLite under control I will try PostgreSQL because it is the 
most recomended robust opensource DBMS I have notice.
    Regards,

Qatan

Hello again.

I keep complaining about the same over and over.

I can't find feet and head watching the whole code at the same place, it 
is hard for me to track it down as i could find talking to other people, 
is still too hard for many.

This time, as a suggestion. Pritpal, when you could make some time for 
it, please, write a manual, a reference guide or something alike. Your 
tool as i've seen is a very powerfull one, but too hard to track the code.
I'm still stuck on procedural programming, so it's harder to me to track 
OOp.

At this moment i'm printing demowvg.prg and start cutting it to see if i 
can track things better, but i guess is not the ideal approach to have a 
wall with paper pieces only to try to follow some code.

I have the best intentions, if i could make anything to help, i would.

Best regards.

.

At this moment, i am at 35 pages, and about 1500 lines of code of about 
4500 lines of code... so this sample program is about 135/140 pages...

you can easy convert your source to gui adding a similar template

so you can maintain your source whith little modification


and then start adding gui element

in systax compatible with xbp but with vgw prefix


Please revise my untested source

Ok, i checked the code, compiled and modifyed, but i'm receiving the 
same ressults no matters wich font i put, no mathers what screen mode i 
tell, there comes always a screen the same size with the same font on it.
This is the part of the code i modified:

               SETMODE(20,25) // (25,50),(25,80),(etc..)
            .
            .
            .
            HB_GTInfo(HB_GTI_FONTNAME, "Verdana") ("Trebuchet MS") (etc..)

So... where can i find some info./manual/reference to study what's wrong 
or what's the correct way to do it? other than asking and asking and 
asking and asking.... that makes so much people get upset and give so 
many useless answers.

Why people makes things available without info.?
Is there some sort of game? "i'm smart and you're an idiot, so this is 
the proof, you cant undestand me"...

If i find a piece of code where i can track some stuff, ok, i may learn 
something and ask whatever i cant understand.
If i find several smallest code files, each with only 1 small function 
procedure or wathever to see how it works... the better, maybe i have 
not to ask.
But this way, where there is no documentation, there is a bunch of code 
and "loose words" as explanations, come on... it seems you do it on 
purpose to avoid others to understand.

If it is so easy why not give a complete answer?
If it is so simple why not make some reference documentation to help others?


Come on men... how do you think Harbour is going to survive or get 
anywhere without giving others the chance to learn about?
Is this just a workaround until the time all of you retire so you have 
not to learn or develop a new compiler?

Did you all learn programming just by watching tons of sensless code 
from others?

Should give my 4 y/o son a book and tell "guess how to read"?


Regards.

Hi Richard

Follow is my information and suggestion

harbour not have jet documentation (is in harbour\doc) because not have
found any developer able to make good documentation, i invite you and
everybody to participate at harbour project writing documentation. mailing
will Developer  collaborate to this project giving valuable information
Harbour will be a good professional experience with one of most powerful and
advanced language

If you want kow harbour The principal source or information is source
code,changelog  and developer mailing list
http://www.harbour-project.org/mailing.html
I have collect same info in my blog http://harbourlanguage.blogspot.com/


Find in prg files in harbour repository and you can find the explain
In this way you can Learn by example like entire harbour community
Harbour is 100% compatible with clipper so you can use any clipper
documentation

When you have a problem try post a sample that explain instead of describe
source code is better that 1000 word because no native English speaking
source code is understand to 100% English test 20%


You can find A commercial product sell for 49 $ the "xHarbour Language
Reference Guide" is very good product also if is 2 year old( I have read
about idea of an upgrade)
https://secure.xharbour.com/order%20online/order.asp?page=index&show_h=2&=



Sorry for my bad English and happy Harbour

This is a open source project.
If you find lack of documentation you are invited to write it.
You can give something instead of whining about voluntary work done by 
others.
If you don't like Harbour there are commercial alternatives where you 
can demmand for what you've paid.

Angel,
while I substancially must agree with the general sense of your post, 
this is not an answer.
And it's quite rude and does not help any newcomers. Moreover, it can 
cause people not to look into Harbour Project at all and stay away from it.
We all -I think- love Harbour not only because it's free, but because it 
has some value DESPITE the fact that it's free.
The lack of documentation IS a problem, and you can't simply tell a new 
user "do-it-yourself and if you don't like it fuck yourself."
Please if you can't be of any help avoid to write at all, this is not 
the spirit of this mailing list.

what is the best way to scale to full screen?
I am using:

Not work.

It is because in WVT|WVG fonts are set calculating the
desktop size / console rows * font height
and width is set accordingly.

There is no way to scale the fonts to windows exact width and height.

Which font you are using? "Courier New" is the best font to scale
to a greater degree.

Is very difficult having right word
Harbour have incomplete documentation but i hope that same English spoken
people will help producing in future
Without documentation harbour will be used learning from his sample and
reading developer mailing list.
hbide have a powerful search in file function that allow me find any
information (in c:h\arbour and subdir) for use part of harbour that i don't
know when i need.
Here and in developer mailing list all user give a reply , good or
bad. Hbide is written in harbour  and is a demonstration of how much
powerfull is harbour http://harbourlanguage.blogspot.com/
The spirit is right must be help us for what be possible to use the most
good language with the  documentation with inverse proportional good

Freedom (monetary) has  nothing to do with it.

Maybe the truth is: Harbour is not ready for users not willing to put 
some effort on it.

> and you can't simply tell a new user "do-it-yourself and if you don't like it fuck yourself."

You are tergiversing by words. And I don't have that kind of language.

Otherwise, It's a very valid answer.
Nobody has the right to ask anything from anybody here.
This package is the cummulative effort of a lot of programmers who have 
donated their time and knowledge without asking anything on return.
Here nobody is selling anything and all contributiona are wellcome, be 
it testing, reporting bugs, documenting, helping newcommers or 
suggesting new features.
If it's not enought for you... I'm sorry.

Richard , if you are trying to start using graphical programming
you can start using Minigui ( in his 3 flavors minigui, oohg or HMG )

Probably is a little more documented ( not full ) and it is easy to learn

These are external projects , and have his own forum lists

Richard,

    There is a good online guide here: 
http://www.xharbour.com/xhdn/referenceguide/
    It requires you to register before having access.
    You can also download a CHM demo version for free there.
    It is for xHarbour that is very similar to Harbour and helps a lot.
    Give it a try and you will like it.

Ok, i checked the code, compiled and modifyed, but i'm receiving the
same ressults no matters wich font i put, no mathers what screen mode i
tell, there comes always a screen the same size with the same font on it.
This is the part of the code i modified:

               SETMODE(20,25) // (25,50),(25,80),(etc..)
            .
            .
            .
            HB_GTInfo(HB_GTI_FONTNAME, "Verdana") ("Trebuchet MS") (etc..)

So... where can i find some info./manual/reference to study what's wrong
or what's the correct way to do it? other than asking and asking and
asking and asking.... that makes so much people get upset and give so
many useless answers.

Why people makes things available without info.?
Is there some sort of game? "i'm smart and you're an idiot, so this is
the proof, you cant undestand me"...

If i find a piece of code where i can track some stuff, ok, i may learn
something and ask whatever i cant understand.
If i find several smallest code files, each with only 1 small function
procedure or wathever to see how it works... the better, maybe i have
not to ask.
But this way, where there is no documentation, there is a bunch of code
and "loose words" as explanations, come on... it seems you do it on
purpose to avoid others to understand.

If it is so easy why not give a complete answer?
If it is so simple why not make some reference documentation to help others?


Come on men... how do you think Harbour is going to survive or get
anywhere without giving others the chance to learn about?
Is this just a workaround until the time all of you retire so you have
not to learn or develop a new compiler?

Did you all learn programming just by watching tons of sensless code
from others?

Should give my 4 y/o son a book and tell "guess how to read"?

There are two problems.
The first one is minor.
   There are no people in Harbour community who find writing
   documentation funny enough to make it for free in their own
   spare time. This is free developer choice and non of us can
   change it. We can only accept current state.
The second one is the real problem.
   Most of people who use Harbour for free and find it really
   good language do not want to spent even small money for
   commercial documentation. xHarbour.com invest quite big
   money to create such documentation which can be used by
   Harbour and xHarbour users and anyone interested can buy it.
   But after few years they didn't received back even 20% of
   invested sum they had to pay for commercial writer (one of
   the best one in the xBase world). Instead we are still seeing
   messages like yours that it's our problem that we haven't
   created such documentation for free. Such messages confirms
   that time and money invested in creating good commercial
   documentation will be lost so probably nothing will change
   in the future.

Hi,

I'm searching for an ebook on Clipper or Harbour, being very rusty in
Clipper since I last used it many years ago :(

Would you know a good link where all the commands (how to create a
dbf, etc.) and functions are all in?

Thanks

Przemys?aw

Is not posible to generate a separate program , precompiled
to browse actual DOC , like Help in HBIDE ?

I think this could have usefull to those that are looking for help
I know that is not a complete help but , actually if somebody like
to use this help need to compile HBIDE , and for an inexpert user
this task may be hard.

For this you do not need to compile hbIDE.

Just download from http://hbide.vouch.info/

It is for Windows though.

I was exaggerating just to be clear... "you can't" here means "one can't"

To ask is a right, to answer is a courtesy...

Please don't be so extreme. I am not entitled to silence anybody and 
don't want it to happen.
Try to figure the frustration of an optimistic newbie that steps into 
Harbour and is used to find tons of documentations about everything. 
Here he must go the hard way.
In other words, It seems we are saying the same things in substance: I 
only recommend to be a bit less severe.
Let's go on studying, helping if we can and, of course, programming!

I like very much your Doc section in HBIDE

yeah, sure! "very well" and "very idealistic"..
(but please keep in mind that idealism is the container of fanaticism 
-and of any obnoxious "-ism" in general. we  don't need them any more.)
"asking" is not only a right, is the "creative trigger" for everything 
being made by human race; and please don't confuse "asking" with 
"demanding" nor "user" with "consumer". Into the subject now, maybe it's 
difficult to understand and accept it but, "documenting" is more 
valuable than "coding" itself. IMHO, documentation is (or must be) on 
upper top, in the scale of open source priorities, since documents, or 
better the lack of documents, is straightly against to the spirit of 
open source initiative, because if open source, due to lack of 
documents, is not easily understandable/self-learn-able, becomes 
unusable to wider programmer-cycles and degenerates to a cryptic tool in 
hands of an illuminated elite, less or not at all, different than closed 
software. And this is a real problem with wider consequences than you 
can imagine. Of course nobody can demand from developers to write 
manuals. All that one could ask from them is to be, their coding, more 
documentation friendly, ensuring this way that their valuable and  very 
respectable labor and creation won't go in vain..

 Hi all

 The above functions are documented in the xHarbour documentation but
don't seem to be part of Harbour, or am I not linking in something I
should be?

 If they don't currently exist what is the best workaround?

if you use other xharbour function use xhb.lib instead try a solution from
hbcompat.ch or a search & replace
#xtranslate hb_DirExists(<x>)           => IsDirectory(<x>)

  * contrib/xhb/hbcompat.ch
    + Added xhb IsDirectory() <-> hb_DirExists() translation.
      Harbour version works using access(), while xhb version
      does a filefind, so Harbour will return a more accurate
      result more quickly, but it won't work with wildcards.

Hi All,

Just an idea about documentation.

AFAIK, Clipper is still owned by CA and I'm pretty sure that it has no 
significant commercial value for them anymore.

Perhaps, if Harbour project administrators ask for it, CA could release 
Clipper documentation with some kind of free license.

So, the only required work to have a complete Harbour documentation, 
could be to write an appendix with Harbour extensions over Clipper.

Just an idea.

Regards,

Roberto.

Is it possible to write a paragraph with some words in bold?

The only way I know to write a paragraph with justify (left, right, ...etc) is with PDF_Page_TextRect
but this function takes the string and outputs it with the previous definied style.

I've think on CA, because they has not desktop development tools 
anymore, so, from its POV, Harbour is not a competitor.

Besides that, releasing Clipper documentation for free could be good for 
them in terms of the relation with the open source community.

As I've said, just an idea.

Anyway, the worst thing that could happen is that they say a big NO! :)

Subject: [Harbour-users] Documentation
Message-ID: <57791.1275002137@people.net.au>

 Hi all

 There has been a lot of discussion about Harbour documentation (or the
lack of it) of late.

 Realistically it must be holding people back from using what is a
wonderful product.? And? many users would be more productive with better
documentation.

 It is also quite understandable because:

 1. The developers of the product are very busy continuing to develop
Harbour for all of us

 2. They are probably not the ideal people to write polished documentation
although anyone who sets out to write such documentation would presumably
want their input

 3. Documentation should ideally cover
 --- multiple supported operating systems
 --- multiple gui and character front ends
 --- multiple data and index formats and access methods
 because most users will want to use a gui front end and a data base back
end.? Covering all that would be a nightmare for an individual as there
are so many options.

 If we consider the Harbour "core" then the problem is much smaller (but
will still leave the average new adopter confused about gui front end and
data back end).? We have

 1. Clipper documentation (of various sorts).? This is helpful but
doesn't cover the myriad of Harbour extensions. 
 2. xHarbour documentation (on line and commercial).? This is probably
more helpful but remains confusing as there are significant differences
between the two dialects and was very much developed for Windows users
although xHarbour came in a Linux version.
 3. Pritpal's hbide (not yet really a newbie option , certainly at this
stage?) and a windows only program
 4. The existing Harbour documentation and changelog etc.? This is useful
but incomplete and awkward to find information assuming it is covered.

 Part of the problem is that users want to access the documentation in
different ways on different platforms.

 As I see it we need three things.

 Firstly we need to agree on a base format for the documentation
content.? This should directly or indirectly support multiple front ends
so that users can ultimately print documentation out or access it
electronically as suits them which could be on line or offline.? We
should be able to write a program to convert existing content to that
format.? It should also be extensible to cover areas such as
contributions, utilities etc and make organising and finding information
easy.

 Secondly we need people to write the content.? One of the biggest issues
there is that, as far as I can see, the first issue hasn't really been
resolved.? Writing documentation isn't easy and takes a lot of time.?
Potential writers want to do the job once and see their work used or there
is no motivation at all.

 Thirdly we need people to write front ends / converters as required so
that the documentation can be accessed in the ways users want on their
platform of choice.? I note that hbide will be a great tool for many, but
adequate alternative tools (not so Harbour oriented) do exist.? I would
rate improved documentation as a much higher priority.

 Addressing the first issue I believe we should consider a format that
Harbour supports "out of the box".? XML would seem to be ideal choice and
very flexible.? Alternately .dbf files with .dbts.

 I would certainly consider contributing to a documentation project but it
would need to have a clear mission and format behind it.

I can see you never even tried hbIDE, your words express it.

hbIDE is platform independent.

 

"not yet really a newbie option" - I assume you mean the "help authoring" part - right ?

Then probably you are wrong. There is "Documentation Writer" widget which has fields

and then saving option to disk. Try once, write a function doc an dsend to the list.

 

Yes of course that component requires some more work, but considering the fact 

that I received no feedback from anyone, what more is required, it got stagnant.

I will be really willing to extend it, show your intent to use.

You may be right and wrong too. It depends on the context of the topic.

We already agreed on the format few months back. Did you went through those messages ?

It is NANFORUM format and whatever documentation Harbour has, is in the SVN under this 

format only. It is easy to convert it to any higher level format. hbIDE presents it in a 

.chm style control already. The code is already there to convert it to PDF or compiled .chm.

But this is a point to be considered once actual help is written.

 

Time and again we fallback on discussing about formats, nobody actually start writing.

 Hi Pritpal

 > I can see you never even tried hbIDE, your words express it.

 > hbIDE is platform independent.

 Yes I know, and I did not express myself clearly enough.? The windows
only program is your alternative to using hbide which you yourself
declared to be windows only.? I should have been more specific.? I in no
way was criticising hbide which is a laudable project and quite an
achievement.? You are correct that I haven't used it - partly because I
have never really gone for any IDE and partly because from my reading of
this group I have figured that, at least for a Linux platform (my choice)
the effort involved might well exceed any benefit that might potentially
be gained.? Plus I have my own Harbour code generator which will
automatically build my major applications for me.? Also I am using GTK.

 > "not yet really a newbie option" - I assume you mean the "help
authoring" part - right ?

 I did put? ", certainly at this? stage?" after that.? I was not
specifically referring to the "help authoring" part. And the question mark
reflected the fact that I was making what I thought was a reasonable
assumption but indicating that it was effectively a question as to the
truth of my contention as well. Rather given that hbide was still under
active development and users were (not surprisingly) reporting issues with
it I felt that using it may not really solve a newbie's problems (certainly
on a Linux platform).? I do sympathise with a lack of feedback.? I am not
sure why that is.? I suppose that many users want to sit back until its
nice and stable and documented etc.? Some my be like me and not looking
for an IDE.? Others may be "shy".

 > We already agreed on the format few months back. Did you went through
those messages ?

 > It is NANFORUM format and whatever documentation Harbour has, is in the

 > format only.

 I did see some discussion (rather limited but maybe I missed some of it)
and did in fact make a post with some suggestions at that point but no-one
responded to my suggestions.? Maybe I didn't see all that had gone on but
my recollection was that "we agreed" means a small group of people (albeit
rather important to the future of Harbour) without really considering all
the alternative suggestions and not agreed amongst active documentation
writers (of which I gather there are currently none with the exception of
your good self perhaps).? An agreement on a format to produce
documentation is pretty meaningless, in my opinion, if no-one is actually
using it to produce documentation.? And maybe its partly to blame as it
is so non-standard and awkward in that format without tools.? The help
authoring tool in hbide may just be the answer to that dilemma, but I
personally think that it is a poor long term choice (the format that is,
not your tools).

 > It is easy to convert it to any higher level format.

 I agree.? It is clearly structured and I have considered doing it
myself.? But why leave it in that format when it is so easy to convert
to, say, XML which is supported by Harbour "out of the (virtual) box"??
Or data tables?? Structured so you can have optional parts - eg for hbqt
if you are using that add on.? But I think that some other issues might
warrant consideration too that may not be addressed by the current format
such as the versions of Harbour that a feature applies to etc.

 > But this is a point to be considered once actual help is written.

 Personally I disagree here.? I think that it needs to be established
before help is written for it to be done well.? And I think that it is
one of the impediments to people actually doing it.

 > Time and again we fallback on discussing about formats, nobody actually
start writing.

 I agree.? But doesn't that suggest to you that there is something that
isn't quite right?

 Above all, please don't take any of the above to be a criticism of anyone
or anything.? Especially not you or any of the developers and maintainers
of Harbour and the many contributions.? Users like me owe so much to you
people.? I would like to spread the word about Harbour but I know people
find it too difficult to get started not because Harbour is difficult but
rather because learning how to use it (documentation) is difficult.? If I
didn't care I wouldn't be spending my time writing messages like this
one.? There is clearly a need out there - look at all the discussion and
that is from people who haven't turned away and are putting in the effort
to at least express an opinion about it.? You know, as the author of
hbide, how difficult it can be to get feedback.? So there is no doubt in
my mind that this area is one in which Harbour could be improved as an
overall product really dramatically.? The people with the experience and
knowledge to produce good documentation are, unfortunately, those who
least need it.? I think there is a way to encourage them but clearly that
has not been hit upon to date.

 To me at least, and others may or may not agree, whilst Harbour has moved
forward and added so many new concepts and features to a truly beautiful
language, hanging on to what is effectively a proprietary format in these
days of open standards is out of keeping with the general Harbour
philosophy.

OK, i'll try to expose in this (and next couple of) message, where the 
foundation of the _real problem_ is, as i see some people can't see it, 
and others just don't care to see it since they are VIP (or they think so).

The main thing i will ask/recommend, is to READ my messages completely, 
AND try to UNDERSTAND what i said.
My english may be not very good so i'm asking help to uncle google (too) 
as i'm writen to try not mess words and meanings.

I know that a programmer is not a Systems analyst, so as we say in my 
country "no le voy a pedir peras al olmo" "i will not ask pears to the 
elm" and will try to do my best explaining this also to people who's not 
prepared to understand problems but only to look ahead and pull a wagon.

First of all, i have to thank all those people who took the time to give 
a selfless and productive answer (in the meaning of non destructive) but 
also, i have to say, that noone of you have given an answer relative to 
what i asked.

So, here is the answer/ask i made to Massimo:

    El 26/05/2010 01:06 a.m., Richard Acosta escribi?:
>     What is xbp syntax?

OK.. so, ?anyone has answered this?
I really don't know what are you talking about Massimo.
This may have looked as a joke, but adding my next answer maybe help to 
understand

    El 26/05/2010 01:45 a.m., Richard Acosta escribi?:
>     (some other stuff) => ...useless answers.


I searched xbp using google, and found a lot of matches 
<http://www.google.com.uy/search?q=xbp&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:es-ES:official&client=firefox-a>...  
as i had matches also about gamming consoles... =-O i added the word 
syntax to search on google 
<http://www.google.com.uy/search?num=100&hl=es&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=GD2&rls=org.mozilla%3Aes-ES%3Aofficial&q=xbp+syntax&btnG=Buscar> 
and had similar ressults.

So.... ?can you develop that idea a bit more?

Massimo, thanks for your time and understanding, but on your answer 
about harbour documentation... i have that doccumentation, but my main 
ask came from a different issue.
I learn dbase, then passed to foxplus and some years later started on 
Clipper Summer 87, and until today i have 2 big clipper 5 books at the 
reach of my hand, just in case.

I started on Harbour project when it was version "0." (dont remember 
exact version, but was low enough)
(this is to who sees himself as a VIP and whinks "newcomers" on xbase 
world are annoying)
I'm not only not a newcomer but i could bet i was programming while some 
of them were in diapers.
But also, is not the age stuff, i have made programms that send and 
receive faxes and email between companies to automate memberships to 
health care services and ISPs using Clipper Summer 87 when internet was 
borning. I hope some of you remember, there was not so much "classes" 
and stuff available as today Today when some people ask for a "function" 
to extract data from a text file...
I'm not a newcomer, and i'm not a child.

Now, i will give a bit of time, to disrespectful people too:

  here you have people.... the most selfish answer you could ever expect 
from a suppossed selfless developer from an (almost) selfless project.
This is a open source project.

As far as i know, a Troll is one looking to provoke trouble. (or 
something alike)

Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29> says:

    In Internet slang <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_slang>, a
    *troll* is someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic
    messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum>, chat room
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_room>, or blog
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog>, with the primary intent of
    provoking other users into a desired emotional
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion> response^[1]
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29#cite_note-PCMAG_def-0>
    or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.^[2]
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29#cite_note-IUKB_def-1>
    In addition to the offending poster, the noun "troll" can also refer
    to the provocative message itself, as in /that was an excellent
    troll you posted/. While the term troll and its associated action,
    /trolling/, are primarily associated with Internet discourse, media
    attention in recent years has made such labels highly subjective,
    with /trolling/ being used to describe many intentionally
    provocative actions outside of an online context.


OK so, as i was:
1) Suggesting Pritpal to improve the "learnability" of his software. 
(magnificent software i may say)
2) Asking for an new answer to an incomplete answer from Massimo.
3) Suggesting in general to take a bit more of time to understand a 
question and answer in a bit more complete manner. (as we have almost 
all the language issue -not xbase language, motherhood language-)

The only who may be considered a Troll should be that people who 
answered intentionally in an inflammatory way, offtopic, provoking 
others, and looking for an emotional response instead of trying to help.
?Could you Angel please read your message/s before continuing?



OK and now answering your first message:

If i'm asking for documentation, saying that i cannot understand the 
written code as every programmer has some sort of "own style"
My question to you is the following:

How could you expect someone asking for a manual to learn a matter could 
write a manual about that matter prior to learn it?

And as i know you didn't understand i will answer for you, but with a 
new question.

Why someone capable of making a manual could be asking for a manual 
about that same matter?

Now:

Don't you think this is a bit contradictory?

Or were you referring to his latest sentence?... if so, i'm sorry to get 
it wrong.

Now, i'm going to develop a bit more that idea of mine, that made you 
"visibly" upset.

I'm trying to go gui, ok?, but i have several years making the almost 
same code and i have a few dozen programms running for decades the same 
way....
I have made several changes to addapt my very old and caveman's code to 
try to escape from structured programming and terminal interfase.
Unsuccessfully!!!

First i changed a very antique menu system i've been using since 
Summer87, very complicated and with a huge code block just to make mouse 
work with it.

    Yeah, the menumodal era came with Harbour.... (but this seems to not
    being used on gui....-it was on fivewin i guess when i did it-)

Then i started to use pdf files to print on USB printers and avoid 
margins and other stuff that makes so much people waste so much time 
trying to adjust to every printer/system.
this came with gtwvw or wvwtools if i'm not wrong, and that was a GREAT 
improvement on my printing system for some very important reasons.

    1) My customer, can track his billing system just opening a folder
    and double-clicking the corresponding type-doc-number.pdf file
    instead of searching papers or handling the accounting system that
    he's not too used to work on.
    2) I can print anything on any printer wihout having to make
    absolute any adjustement to my code.
    3) I can fully automate printing or allow the user to watch and save
    a bill prior to print or not-print-it at all, without changing the exe.
    4) He can email a "secure" PDF of his sales check (bill) or even
    fax-it directly.

This two simple changes made my code go years ahead (or come years from 
behind), and i had only to watch and track only a couple of functions in 
some very small and simple provided samples.

    Time for implementation of any of this changes (and some other non
    mentinoned) : no more than 1 day each. So you can see the
    cost/benefit ratio it's hugely to my side, wich makes me more than
    interested to use it.


But:

When i started to see Pritpal's code, i have found it more complex than 
the Big Flying Spaghetti Monster. Only this has no meetballs for eyes 
and does not fly, but is really a big spaguetti monster.

When i make a program, i split the code in several smaller files, so, 
functions/classes/etc... that make things alike, go in a file, and 
functions/classes/etc, that make different things but similar to each 
other go in a different file.
Also, every prog, class, function, etc... has a header that has it's 
name, a brief explanation of it's parameters, what it does, what is for 
and what expects to be passed to it as you can see on the following text:

    ******************************
    ** Funci?n mezcla
    ** Combino funciones de busqueda, uso de flechas y edicion
    ** 15/01/05
    ** auxi_busca=space(0) para que empiece limpio
    ** empieza=1 para no mantener la ultima tecla en buffer
    ** base=1 o 2 o depende de la cant. de bases de datos que use
    ** edieli=1 o 0 si dejo eliminar datos
    ******************************************************************
    function mezcla
         parameters m, camponom, ncam
         cursorcampo=campob[camponom]
    .
    .


So, when i have to track a piece of my own code i can have Notepad++ or 
CrimsonEditor (now emerald) open with several tabs, one for every .prg 
file and not having to go up and down constantly .nor. print the whole 
code just to watch what's going on.
Even if i have to print it all, i'm still able to print a whole lot 
lesser pages to have it all.
And if tomorrow a different programmer has to take my code and modify 
it, he can track things easier.... i hope.


What i was suggesting Pritpal is that you may split the code in a 
similar manner if you cannot write something to make it understandable, 
that's all.

If your code is more learnable, more people is going to like it, and 
more people is going to use it, but as long there is someone who thinks 
is impossible to track the begginning and the ending of a big spaguetti 
monster, there is gonna be some people forced to ask, people that will 
complain and people who would'nt be able to help you on developing or 
doccumenting.

So, if you don't want others to help you improve your "goddish" product 
or help you on doccumenting and help you help others... is ok, but thell 
things clear.

Bruno, i satrted on minigui, but i cannot advance, since OOp is still 
making me headaches...
That's whi i tought Pritpal's code could help me better.

I have parts of several programs started using minigui, but i end always 
having some sort of issue that go beyond my knowledge and doccumentation 
available.

I'm also suscribed to minigui list, but it seems inactive...

Just to clearfy... (again) i was asking Pritpal's for some 
doccumentation or a more easy to track code.

Richard ,
Nobody here is a Vip,
For you isn't good my works when i try support user on mailing list (i admin
bad)
For you isn't good Pritpal as developer (imo Pritpal whih hbqt.hbxhb,hbide
will resolve problem more big than your )
 "Flying Spaghetti Monster" not sound good but please try give your contrib
to harbour so we can evaluate how much you are rock



xbp is acronimo for xbase++parts is a gui class made from alaska software

And you still don't know why people doesn't answer  you ?

Guess..

1) There is a HUGE Changelog where all your questions are answered and 
you dont even dare to read it because your time is more important than 
developpers time. So you ask someone else to digest it for you.
Bite the bullet and read it all before asking.

2) If you receive a NO as an aswer o don't receive an answers at all, 
asking again won't change it.

You say you're not a child but you act like that !!

Message-ID: <AANLkTimkNowUVz1x_SPD9j4aZx9gJXR4QMw55j4u8gS0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

How to make an incremental build of Harbour libs?

I mean, that for example I just modified a contrib and want to only
re-generate this contrib.

I usually do

win-make clean
win-make install

so.. is there any flag to instruct an incremental build ??

Many thanks for your help.

you can type only
win-make install
or if you want update only temporay path
win-make

you can launch inside your contrib
C:\harbour\contrib\hbwin>..\..\win-make

same contrib wil be compiled using hbmk2 with hbp
CD \HARBOUR\EXAMPLES\GTWVW
hbmk2 gtwvw.hbp

You are right. According Wikipedia:

"On April 22, 2002 Computer Associates and GrafX Software announced they
had reached a Development, Licensing, and Marketing Agreement for two of
their software development languages -- CA-Clipper and CA-Visual Objects."

Sorry.

Another idea (could be a little 'naive', I know):

Harbour is very popular today. If xHarbour docs were bundled with 
Harbour compiler distro, it could serve to xHarbour.com as publicity for 
its commercial products and services.

So, both parts will be benefited: Harbour will get documentation and 
xHarbour, publicity.

Harbour does not have any of the things that xHarbour sell, so this 
could be a good complementation.

For xHarboour.com, the money they invested in documentation, will be 
transformed in advertising, so, it will be not lost.

Sorry for the naive-ness of the post :)


Regards,

Roberto.

how to create harbour documentation?
Click on find in file  search in c:\harbour\src and subdir
Open source code in editor from find in file
Click on "Documentation Writer"    icon on the right-toolbar,

Position cursor somewhere inside a function body,
Click on "Load from current function" icon on the top-toolbar of "Document
Writer" widget,


Look at the contents, few fields will be auto filled with various info from
current function,
Complete the other fields with relevent information,

Click on "Save the documentation with current function",
Look at the function body in the editor, The NANFORUM compliant
documentation will be inserted at the top of function's prototype.
Click on "Save written/updated documentation" icon, and provide the filename
to save on disk,
Copy such generated .txt in /harbour/doc/en,
Open "Harbour Document Viewer" and you should be viewing newly written
documentation there. Such generated file is ready to be uploaded to SVN,
just send it to the list and group will decide if it needs something extra.

Hi All

- Does Harbour have COMPRESSSTRING(), UNCOMPRESSSTRING() functions ?
(equivalents (?) of xHarbour's  CHARPACK() and CHARUNPACK() functions)

  (  According to a Harbour.chm, yes; according to hbmk2, no; even REQUEST;
  ( undefined reference to ... )  )

- hbmk2 say :

  ...lib/libhbct.a(charop.o):charop.c:(.text+0xa40): multiple definition of
`HB_FUN_CHARXOR'
  ...lib/libcrypt.a(c_crypt.o):c_crypt.c:(.text+0x0): first defined here

-  Harbour give "4" for expression :

   LEN( W2BIN( BIN2W( 2^10 ) ) ) )

   According to a Harbour.chm, W2BIN() return a two bytes character string.
AFAIK "W" stand for "word" and word is "16 bit encoded unsigned short
integer"; does I'm wrong?

Regards

I have read so much about this lately, that i cannot let this past on.

You should'nt be affraid about what others think.
You should'nt be worry if others think you're critizing when your 
intentions are good enough. (at least you know so)
If others don't understand you, that's other's problem and are others 
who need to learn reading or use reading comprehension correctly.
If you have good intentions and others missinterpret your words, then 
others are who have bad intentions, you just don't have to be sorry, 
others are.

> Users like me owe so much to you people.
This is the main trouble, there is too much people who think themselves 
are so important and think we, the others are insignificant just because 
we don't know as much as they.
So, we do not owe anything to anyone. They owe us respect as a primary 
thing, and then we may be grateful (in the way anyone wants to be), but 
that's all.
Do not turn you down, you're not less than anyone, you're just on a 
different level or approach or branch.

I don't think this about harbour, but i do about some other projects 
related to it.

> If I didn't care I wouldn't be spending my time writing messages like this one.
>    
For some people, it seems if you care, you're a Troll... so please, 
don't clarify your intentions, we, the decent and caring people, know 
what the true intentions behind the words are.
Machines don't think and psychopaths don't care, so next time, before 
clarify anything or when being critisized have that in mind and don't be 
sorry, you'll find it does not mathers if you do it or not.

> You know, as the author of hbide, how difficult it can be to get feedback.  So there is no doubt in

Here, you have touched a sensitive point, and here are my questions.
For one side, Pritpal says he has'nt received any feedback, so he can't 
improve his products.
On the other hand.... i have provided some feedback and some 
suggestions, as you're doing and you did... but clearly he does not care 
about this feedback, as he thinks feedback has to be always fullfilled 
with flowers and congratulations.
So now, i embrace your talk and say
NOT EVERY FEEDBACK HAS TO AGREE WITH WHAT YOU DO.
NOT EVERY CRITICISM HAS TO BE A BAD THING.
As in my country we say, "La cr?tica es siempre constructiva" "Criticism 
is always constructive", if you're doing something wrong, it may help 
you improve, if you're doing something right it may help you improve.
To make things get positive or negative, is an approach from the side of 
the receiver.

Yes, there is a way, is to pay them, that's the price of their

I don't care about using closed source while the product is good enough.
And i really appreciate the existence of open source products, but like 
they are good enough as closed source products they also have other 
severe shortages and some times as important as the rest of the project.

You can make anything what you want with .hrb files body. You only
have to decode it before you will call HB_HRBLOAD( <cHrbBody> ), f.e.
you can use this function to compress and encrypt .hrb files:

  proc encode_hrb( cKey )
     local cHrbBody, file
     for each file in directory( "*.hrb" )
        cHrbBody := hb_memoread( file[ 1 ] )
        if !empty( cHrbBody )
           cHrbBody := hb_zcompress( cHrbBody )
           cHrbBody := sx_encrypt( cHrbBody, cKey )
           hb_memowrit( file[ 1 ] + "enc", cHrbBody )
        endif
     next
     return

and this one to load such files:

  proc load_hrb( cKey, cFile, /* init function parameters*/ ... )
     local cHrbBody
     cHrbBody := hb_memoread( cFile )
     cHrbBody := sx_decrypt( cHrbBody, cKey )
     cHrbBody := hb_zuncompress( cHrbBody )
     hb_hrbLoad( cHrbBody, ... )
     return

In both functions <cKey> is used as encryption key. It's not strong
encryption but for simple string hiding should be enough.

Przemek

I do not know COMPRESSSTRING() and UNCOMPRESSSTRING() and AFAIK
xHarbour does not contain such functions.

CHARPACK() and CHARUNPACK() are Clipper Tools functions which exists
in HBCT library.
To use them you have to add HBCT library to linked library list using
'-lhbct' hbmk2 switch. Both Harbour and xHarbour use the same
implementation of this function which supports only method 0 and
method 1 (bit oriented algorithm in CA-CT3) is not supported.

Harbour has also few other compression method much more efficient.
In core code it support SIX3 compatible compression Sx_Compress()/
Sx_Decompress() and ZLIB compatible HB_ZCOMPRESS()/HB_ZUNCOMPRESS().
In hbbz2 library it also supports BZIP2 compression HB_BZ2_COMPRESS()/
HB_BZ2_UNCOMPRESS(). It needs BZIP2 compression library and -lhbbz2
-lbz2 hbmk2 switches. HBBZ2 library is not available in Harbour2.0.
In xHarbour there are also HB_COMPRESS() and HB_UNCOMPRESS() functions.
They are wrappers to ZLIB library and available in Harbour in xHarbour
compatibility library (xhb.lib). To use them you need to specify
-lxhb HBMK2 switch but I strongly suggest to use native Harbour
ZLIB API which has much cleaner interface (HB_ZCOMPRESS()/HB_ZUNCOMPRESS())

Sorry but libcrypt.a is not part of Harbour.
I do not know where did you take this library from and what it does
but it tries creates name conflict with CHARXOR() function in HBCT
library. You should contact with this library author and ask about
the fix.

You are right. It's typo in W2BIN() in HBXPP (xbase++ compatible) library.
I'll fix it ASAP. Thanks for the info.

Hi Massimo

Thanks for quick response

For crypt/decrypt (or decode/uncode) we will find other (strong or not) ways
of course.

My intend was to notify any problem (if exist) in the harbour.

Hi,

I am in the process of reverting my relativly large app back to harbour.

Currently I am looking at using several windows with GTWVT. I was 
wondering if there is a way to bring one of the windows to the front,

Does anybody now how to do this?
