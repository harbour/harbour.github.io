We Rock!

By Steve Litt

My first copy of "The C Programming Language" disintegrated in 
1995 when the duct tape that held together finally gave up. It had 
been a constant backpack companion since 1984 when I used it to 
first learn C. Back in the days when I programmed professionally 
all day, then went home and banged out Turbo Pascal on my 
Kaypro 2x just for fun. 

Back in those days I used to laugh at the old guys whose every 
thought involved a goto. Today I'm amazed at the arrogance of my 
youth. 

It didn't cross my mind those guys didn't grow up with the luxury of 
64K of memory to save subroutine states and return addresses. 
They had to make do with 1K or less, and they did it admirably. 
Older and wiser, today I know I don't have the intelligence to write 
such code. My generation was the first who could afford to 
substitute RAM for intelligence. The guys who came before us 
established programming as an activity and a profession. They did 
their job superbly. 

The structured guys took programming from the research facility to 
the business, then to the home, and finally to what would someday 
be called "the enterprise". With their truly prolific functional 
decomposition design paradigm and their cowboy mentality, they 
could write programs with double the functionality in half the time. 
Their language of choice? C! By the time their era ended, their 
code was everywhere, including the architecture of the Internet. 

Somewhere in the early or mid 1990's the structured crew handed 
the baton to the OOP guys. These guys could assemble a serious 
app out of a bunch of prefabricated object before functional 
decomposition got down to the fourth level. When they couldn't find 
an object, they built their own. They built objects independent of 
any language, that could be linked in at run time. They were called 
"developers", "application developers", and "software engineers", 
but they continued the proud tradition of "programmers". They run 
the world, and run it well. On the way, the OOP era took a detour. 
Many OOP development environments were created to fill 
marketing needs, not to produce robust code. Serious bugs 
cropped up. 

Open Source to the rescue. Using the ancient C language 
combined with their knowledge of modern OOP concepts, they 
created small, fast, modular and robust software. Others used new 
Open Source programming languages such as Python and Perl to 
achieve remarkable productivity. Programmers have always loved to 
make money in the day and program at night (some vice versa). 
They were quick to join Open Source projects. Armed with the 
surprisingly versatile and long lived C language, and the best of 
modern OOP concepts (devoid of the cow pies that often 
accompanied popular OOP), they produced spectacularly clean 
code. 

We rocked in the 50's, when you could list the worlds programmers 
in an address book. We rocked in the 60's, when geniuses plied 
their gotos in assembler, Cobol and Fortran. We rocked in the 70's, 
when we codified design concepts in preparation for large projects 
yet to come. We rocked in the structured 80's with our conquest of 
every business with more than 10 employees. And we rock in the 
90's with our OOP, web, and Open Source programming. We eat 
too much pizza and drink too much coffee. We fly airplanes and 
ride skateboards. We have long gray beards and faces devoid of 
peach fuzz. We live in every nation on this earth, and we work 
together on a daily basis. And most of all, we pound out great 
code. From the first guy to boot a computer with patch cords, to 
the guy starting a Free Software project in his basement, we take 
pride in this world we've built.

That's a good attempt at rewriting history, considering that languages like
python and perl existed before the mid 1990s.

Why do I get this feeling of "those who can, code. Those who can't,
stereotype"?

Hi,

Does anyone know where to find IVR (Interactive Voice Response) components
in order to automate telephone based applications?

What I mean is is that if the user calls to a specific number, my computer
modem must answer and then a recording must say:

"Hi, you're at the main menu. Press 1 for cinema, 2 for theaters."

Then users chooses one of the options by pressing the telephone key and then
is guided to a sub menu and so on...

Is there such component on the market?

If that's the same "press release" that I read earlier today, it's damn

I think you'll find that the subject under discussion was Linus' writing
style, something which is of his own doing. For as long as I can remember
Linus has always had a knack of writing amusing release announcements for
kernel releases.

Why is acknowledging Linus' ability to write amusing text "the same old
mistake"?

Well, I may be influenced by a recent reading I did from
the reader's digest magazine 2001 January -where Linus is
on the cover page with the Linux pet and a guru smile- and
where you can read "The solitaire genius of Linus Torvalds..."
(Reader's Digest has elected him as the European of the year).

When you read the entire article you read a -huge- lot of
stupidities, one after another, and you find a clear sign 
of trying to turn him into an hero.

That is the same old story I am refering to. People love to 
have heroes, heroes they can adore, and heroes they can 
later through to the mud.

We don't need heroes. We just need to better know ourselves
(and that is something really difficult, too difficult).

I don't think that crap reporting on the part of Reader's Digest really says
anything about Linus' obvious ability to write amusing things.

You can actually be "better" and have heros. Not that I see Linus as one,
far from it. I still don't see how acknowledgement of Linus' amusing release
announcements really has anything to do with the obvious lack of reporting
skills of those who write articles about him in dodgy magazines.

Antonio,

Indeed amazing, I'm still trying to understand what makes this subject more
interesting than  the message from Shashkov yesterday on the Harbour list.

I somehow hope the reason you choose to engage in this conversation, while
ignoring what to me appear far more important, may simply be, you didn't see
that message. If this is the case, here is a link to the message on the
Harbour Archives:

Perhaps you should ponder the difference between "more interesting" and
"easier to respond to". I mean, I can't and won't speak for Antonio but I'll
often leave interesting or important emails a few days while I'll happily
muck about with the trivial.

Antonio's allowed some trivial mucking about isn't he?

Dave,

Indeed possible. I still think it is very important to, at least acknowledge
an important message, in a timely manner.

Like you I can't speak for Antonio, but *I* would post something, like:
Thanks for the input, I can't review the details at this point, but will do
so in the next few ...

I think it is extremely important to do so, especially, if at the same time
you seem to respond to other messages. I mean, if you don't seem active at
the time, one can assume you didn't get to see the message yet, but if you
respond to other messages, one might wonder, whether you missed his/her
message.

As to not create ambiguity, or even worse discouragement, *I* would, as a
matter of courtesy, at least indicate, that I saw a message, that is likely
to warrant my delayed response.

Yes, we are all "allowed" some trivial mucking around, but the "recruiting"
of someone like that guy, to *me*, appears far more important.

Never! I simply shared his amazement at how different we all are. I was sure
he would be more interested in the technical details brought by Shashkov,
than the writing style, and/or hero status, of Linus.

Dave,

Just a small note to tell you I've finally, visited your homepage.

Enjoyed reading your "THE PROJECT" articles, and downloaded DGScan & WEG.
Both programs worked flawlessly. I really like WEG and expect to never again
use my NG reader :-).

Thanks,

Ron

I'd just like to echo those comments about WEG - I haven't used NG.EXE for 
years, now. WEG is fantastic!

Glad you like it, thanks for the kind words. I've actually got a directory
here with a tiny bit of code in it for WEG2, WEG done properly (the first
WEG started as a four day get-to-know-delphi hack), but WEG "works for me"
so I keep lacking the motivation to really get it going. :)

Actually I almost added that if Clipper was still a viable marketing 
target, WEG would be a marketable product.

Well, WEG is actually shipped with at least one product that I know of. Hmm,
I'm not sure that actually counts as "being sold". Yeah, thanks for the
compliment though, I do think WEG would have been a "goer" way back when.

Knowing what I know now I'd still have made it free software, which doesn't
actually stop people paying the author, it simply means they get to decide
if they appreciate the code enough to pay the author. Pretty fair really.

DGSCAN was free-of-cost but lacked source for a long time. <slap>

Shareware isn't good enough for WEG or WEG isn't good enough for shareware?

Dave,

<bg>

jokes apart...

You should add new fatures to WEG that would justify an upgrade,
so you may have an oportunity to ask money for it.

What about exporting a NG to a RTF format, so it may turned easily
into a Windows help file ?

Also, something I always dreamed of was a NG reader (like WEG) that
would allow to modify on-line the NG contents...

A nice idea from a friend. Don't miss this collection
of Clipper adds:

In particular, I found there the one
I was looking for so many time:

Hi Al,

I know this may sounds a silly question but...

The other day I saw a good bunch of Reference(Clipper)
magazines I have here and I asked myself...

Do you think is there a chance to get all Reference(Clipper)
magazines and place them on the web ? (PDF format?)

Or may it be a copyright infringement ?

Antonio

I'd have thought that it would be very likely that it would infringe on
someone's copyright. Is there a copyright message in the mag?

Then you check that the rights weren't passed onto another company or
individual. It's also probably worth checking that the individual articles
aren't the copyright of their authors.

During the last "fiasco" I only got an invitation (which I ignored). This
morning I find that I've actually been subscribed to the list without my
permission.

Yep, I've sent a strongly worded email to the abuse department at Yahoo,
pointing out that this isn't the first time that this has happened and
unless they pull the privileges of the list owner it's obvious that they
condone his actions and, given this, Yahoo will be seen as a company that
support opt-out mailing lists.

Perhaps the trick to combating this is to subscribe an address to the list
that is an alias for the eGroups abuse email address? That might get some
action. ;>

Of course, I've just realised that their so-called abuse address is nothing
more than an auto-responder that says "yeah, ok, so someone signed you up
when you didn't want to, hard cheese, unsubscribe you winging fool". Talk
about supporting opt-out lists.

So, I'm wondering, does anyone happen to have an email address for a real
live human who I can register a formal complaint with?

Are you sure it wasn't from Yahoo? What I got was a statement that I
had already been joined to the list. The message listed the new Yahoo
address (Yahoo bought eGroups). I forwarded the message to Yahoo's abuse
address.

...which gets you an automated response along the lines of "don't be such a
cry-baby, just go and unsubscribe while we allow the abuser to get away with
it to do it again".

I stumbled into this frame in which to complain:

http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/mb/cgi_abuse

Also, notice this statement found in small print at the bottom of the
screen:

"NOTICE: We collect personal information on this site."

It is a great thing that the Harbour reflector is no longer on egroups.

Thank you.

Well, I've now sent emails asking for a proper abuse address to the support
address and to <URL:mailto:privacypolicy@yahoo-inc.com>. The reason for the
latter address is:

,----
| SPECIAL NOTE FROM Yahoo! Groups: Because Yahoo! Groups values your

`----

It seems quite clear from the automated abuse responses that they *don't*
value my privacy so I think it makes sense to ask the privacy "officer" (I'm
assuming there's a human at the end of that message) why this is the case
and how we can go about either a) getting the list shut down or b) getting
the list owner's account pulled.

BTW, see <URL:http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16447.html>. Evidence,
if any more was required, that our move away from eGroups didn't come a
moment too soon.

CC: The usual suspects.

Well, I had an email from Goran this morning. I won't quote it word for word
as quoting private email without permission is rude. In summary, he's
claiming that he didn't subscribe anyone in the last couple of days but that
he did send out some more invitations. He also claims that I wasn't amongst
that invitation list as I'd turned down the previous invitation. Presumably
the same is true of everyone else who had been resubscribed against their
wishes.

He suggests that the cause of this unfortunate turn of events is the eGroups
to Yahoo conversion that happened over the weekend. While it's true that
there are problems <URL:http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16447.html>
with the move I find it really hard to believe that this is the case of this
abuse of the eGroup system and our email addresses.

Dave,

Well, I used to fire off emails on abuse for all unsolicited email.  I find
that I usually get a response in a couple of days, and the offender no
longer has an account.  SO ... when you send in the complaint, it gets
handled, but it takes time.

I have been getting messages recently that boast 150 million email accounts
on a mailing list.  The guys who have these lists certainly make enough
money.  Over here there are seminars every weekend about how to get rich
quick using the internet.  Every one that signs up gets a sample letter, and
the name of a source for an email list.  Same letter, same source, to
everyone.  So the people run home, and use their credit card to pay for a
bulk email ... and all these people get the same message, different person,
several times in a short period of time.

The money is significant enough that everytime the list guy gets shut down,
he simply signs up somewhere else.

So ... I finally gave up and just hit the delete button.  I know we
shouldn't have to do this, but the scam scum will always have a way to find
us !

Thankfully I have a virus scan because some emails now bring unwanted gifts
... my very own happy virus !

Tim

Subject: [HarbourTalk] The old eGroups harbour lists
Message-ID: <20010131072859.X15200@hagbard.davep.org>

I received an email from the old eGroups harbourtalk mailing list this
morning. Seems someone didn't know we'd moved to our own (trustworthy) list
server.

Can we in some way close down the old lists at eGroups? Or, at the very
least, bulk unsubscribe everyone from it?
