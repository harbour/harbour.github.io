Hi,

I have a web site where my clients can download upgrades of my software.
The pages uses ASP and are hosted on my own server that has Windows 2000 on
it.

Does anyone know how it is possible to know if my client has actualy
downloaded the upgrade?
I need to update a database that marks a file as "downloaded".
I need to know for SURE if the file is downloaded by my client. So actualy,
the ASP page needs to wait till the file is downloaded. If succefull
downloaded, update the database.

Thanks!

Patrick,

I think you can send an HTTP POST message from the Installation Exe. This is
slightly different than marking a download it actually marks successful
download, followed by installation of such download.

Please let me know when you finalize this issue, as I would be interested in
same.

Ron

It's a hard task Patrick. I don't think any implementation will be 100%
failproof. I think we should discuss the method first. Why do you need to
mark the file as downloaded on the database? In order to avoid duplicate
downloads? But what if the user copies the downloaded file?

I just want to know if he already downloaded the file. Just to inform the
client at next visit that he already has the file.
But I want to avoid that the user presses the download button by accedent,
and than presses the cancel button. In a "normal" APS solution this way the
file would be marked as "downloaded".

So I need to know. "Is the file successfull downloaded by the user"?
It is not a matter of copy protection.

Can the server KNOW in some way that the file is downloaded?
Via it's statistics??

Patrick,
It is no sense of your job. The file could be downloaded and broken because
of some errors. What then?
Ron is right. The only way to solve your problem is to make some
self-extracting installer in .exe file.

No. You can never guarantee that the user has downloaded the whole file.
What you can do is create a download page where you have a link "Click here
when the download ends" and redirect to the file download. Later you can
have an explanation, something like "(this will prevent you from downloading
this version again)" or something.

IMHO, this is the best approach.

Patrick,

There is another way, you can definitely know FOR SURE if the Download
COMPLTEED. Look for example at the Microsoft Windows Update page. Microsoft
knows what you downloaded, and their page will even show automatically a
"Finished" message when you are done.

To do this Microsoft uses an ActiveX component, that downloads the file,
installs it, and reports back to the site when completed.

100% agreed, but some considerations: ActiveX are harder to develop and
harder to deploy (since you need to have licensing stuff otherwise your
client browser won't accept it), not cross platform (only works with IE 3+
and Windows OS) and such... I think it's not worth. I go for the KISS way:
"click here when the download finishes".

But that's just my personal opinion.

By way of illustration: Almost everything I download for use on my Windows
boxes is actually downloaded on my Linux box (either using netscape or
wget). A download procedure that requires that a) I have to be using a
specific operating system to do the download (or worse, a specific web
browser) and/or b) I install the software there and then, while I'm still
connected to the net (dial-up connection here are davep.org) is a download
procedure that is, IMO, broken.

That said, "click here when the download finishes" feels inelegant too.

Luiz:
In your httpd.conf add this outside any structure (eg: at the end of the
file)

ScriptAlias /hs/ "C:/path to hscript dir/"
Action application/x-httpd-hscript "/hs/hscript.exe"
AddType application/x-httpd-hscript .hs

The /hs/ may be whatever you want, it's a virtual dir to hold your
executable.
I haven't tested it, it's a rewrite of what I have for PHP.
I hope it works.

In C, you can reference strings as arrays of characters, so it's even easier
than clipper (just remember it's 0-based):

thefun( cCad[0] ) ;  // A
thefun( cCad[1] ) ;  // B

Brian...

In my old knowledge about C... i know that, but i try to use but dont work..

I am receive a char far from _param(n,-1), after, use the _putc( cCad ), tu
put in the stack, but have errors in runtime.

example.

char * cCad = _param( 1,-1);
_putc( cCad ); // Work Ok.

_putc( cCad[1] ) ; /// Don't Work.

Have any idea ?

I send after all the code.

It would help if you said how it "don't work". Do you get a compiler error,
some form of run-time error? No error but it doesn't do what you'd expect?

Here's a stand alone bit of C code that does what you're doing, it compiles
ok and runs just fine:

,----
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ cat foo.c
| #include <stdio.h>
|=20
| char *getstringthing( void )
| {
|     return( "Hello, World" );
| }
|=20
| int main( void )
| {
|     char *p =3D getstringthing();
|=20
|     putc( p[ 1 ], stdout );
|=20
|     return( 0 );
| }
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ make foo
| cc     foo.c   -o foo
| davep@hagbard:~/temp$ ./foo

Gustavo:
The main thing here is knowing clearly what your function parameter types
are.
Are we talking about the harbour API for receiving a parameter (using FWH
headers to convert _param to hb_param)?

> _putc( cCad ); // Work Ok.
_putc is receiving a pointer to a string
> _putc( cCad[1] ) ; /// Don't Work.
_putc is receiving a single byte.

Which is it supposed to get?
Is _putc one of the old DOS putchar type of functions for stdout?  If so,
there's probably a better choice of function there.

Hi,

    Does anyone know about terminal emulator which can emulate

Thanks in advance.

What are you after when you say you want it to emulate a "Linux console"?
Are you after a telnet client that requires that $TERM is "linux"? Have a
search for "Dave's Telnet" (no, nothing to do with me) AKA "dtelnet". It
seems to do a pretty good job of it.

I can't recall what the licence terms are.

Appears to be because unlike Clipper, in C a string is NOT the same as a
char, it is an ARRAY of char. You need to convert your single char to a
string of 1 char, that means an array of 2 chars, your required char + '\0'.
Like this:

char sTmp[2]
char * cCad = _param( 1,-1);

/* Set once */
aTmp[1] = 0;

_putc( cCad ); // Work Ok.

_putc( cCad[1] ) ; /// Don't Work.

aTmp[0] = cCad[1];
_putc( (char *) aTmp ); // Should Work.


Or you could:

int i, nLen = strlen( cCad );

for( i = 0; i++; i < nLen )
{
   aTmp[0] = cCad[i];
   _putc( (char *) aTmp ); // Should Work.
}

Hi,

The examples are compiled ok in C, but dont do the correct work.

I have in Clipper:

CLS
? Test()

I have in C:

extern void  _retc( char * );

void pascal TEST()
{
  char * cCad1 = "ABC" ; // any string from clipper like  _parc(n)
  _retc( cCad1 ); // Obiously work ok, sending all the string

  // _retc( cCadx ); // I need pass A
  // _retc( cCadx ); // I need pass B
  // _retc( cCadx ); // I need pass C .. and so forth... ( char by char )
}
***
I need pass to clipper any string received char by char ( letter by
letter )..

I try to use:

_retc( cCad1[1] ) // Dont work
_retc( ( char * ) cCad1[1] ) // Compiled ok, but send trash to clipper.

I try to create other var and pass only a letter but too..

char cCad2[1];

cCad2[1] = ( char ) cCad1[1] ;

_retc( ( char * ) cCad2[1] ) // compiled ok, but send trash to clipper.

Gustavo:
OK! There's a big difference between putc types of functions and _retc() to
return a string back upt to clipper (is this for harbour ?)

You have three choices as I see it.  Easiest is to stop trying to return a
string and just use _retni(cCad1[n]) to return the ascii character value,
and have the PRG code receive that value:

? Test() >> 65
? chr(Test()) >> "A"

Or, you can return the string pointer starting at the desired offset in the
string, and let the PRG code worry about limiting to one character:

_retc(cCad)    >> returns whole string
_retc(cCad + 1)    >> returns pointer to string starting at second
character, so
? Test() >> "BCD"
But you have to careful if you start messing with pointers this way--if you
get out of range you get nasty errors.

Better yet, use
_retclen(cCad + n, 1);

...which will return only 1 character.

Brian

Brian,

Well your are right, is so different _retc() and _putc().

In my new example i use _retc() only to demonstrate/ask how i can send only
a character from a string get from clipper, to a function that receive a
 char * ) or ( char far * ).

Really i dont need _retc(), i need _putc().... excuseme i only wish write
the example with other function.

Your open my mind and have an idea.... i try to do it and comment after.

Regards

Yes, I though about a telnet program which could emulate a linux console.

I will try to find it.

Depends, do you really mean device or do you mean a mounted "device"? In the
latter case the answer is, to some degree, that everything is removable
because you can umount anything that's mounted.

That depends. Do you mean from the command line or from code? In the former
case you'd use df(1), in the latter case you'd use statfs(2).

I've already implemented the latter as part of harbour-glibc (see my harbour
page):

Wouldn't it make more sense to report it on the developer's list (and
perhaps document the nature of the problem too)?

The app simply GPFs.

I'm now aware of a portable method of doing this. Actually, I'm not aware of
a method of doing this just for Linux. Keep in mind what I said about how
any "device" (I'm thinking filesystem here really) is "removable" because
you can unmount them.

Failing that, /usr/src/linux/Documentation (assuming you've got the kernel
source installed) might hold some clues, as might the source for the various
device drivers.

What is it exactly? 

[No, I didn't download. I don't speak Spanish and I obviously don't download
 random software off the net and run it, especially when I don't know the
 source and I don't know what it's supposed to do.]

Dave,

It is a bussiness management software.

The language does not matter, it is the design
of the app.

Antonio

It seems to be FALSE ALERT!
I tested the exe with AVP and Polish Antivir MkS_Vir using the latest
updates and found 0 infected files.
I think that uvscan is too sensitive and warns every Outlook/OutlookExpress
user of every exe attached in a mail - but that exe was in a zip file.
Someone (admin/postmaster of xnetcuyo.com.ar server) should change uvscan
settings or maybe change antivirus to AVP.

Subject: [HarbourTalk] An tip of how to speed up harbour app
Message-ID: <004901c0cfe4$213b4740$52d4d7c8@luizguim>

Dear Friends

I´ve seen this on th borland.public.cppbuilder.commandlinetools

The default behavior when using bcc32 , is that he automaticaly defines
_WIN32_WINNT=0x500 and WINVER=0x0500, witch defined that the app will run on
an WINME or WIN2K.

if you define _WIN32_WINNT=0x400 and WINVER=0x400 , the compiler know that
the targer app is for the Win95/98/NT4 windows OS

I´ve done this test and got about 5-10% os speed on the apps

You don't quite say what you were hoping for comments on.

On My system.(Pentium MMX/200Mhz/16Mb) is take 70s to load the page.

It is not an alert in the first place, so it can't be a false alert. It
is actually a notice that the message was not delivered to the final
destination, because the ISP has a policy of not delivering any email
that has executable attachments. But the message is available from a
holding directory, in case the recipient wishes to risk virus
contamination by receiving the email anyway. I discovered this by using
copy and paste between the original message and
http://babelfish.altavista.com/ and selecting spanish to english.
