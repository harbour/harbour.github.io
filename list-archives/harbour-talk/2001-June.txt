As far as I see it, there is always a reason
to build free software.

Dave, you have developed WEG, so you may be 
sincere here and explain why you did it.

And, if that is the case, then for sure he has "non-free" time
where he has to build things that are "not free"...

Your assumption is correct. A large part of my day is spent writing non-free
software that runs in non-free environments. It's for this reason that none
of my free programming time is spent on non-free software.

This seems to be a very common state of affairs for most people who support
free software, yourself included.

Note, however, that because no DNS entry exists for
taz.fiberhosting.com, my ISP's SMTP server lists it as possibly forged,
because it can't confirm that the host name and IP address match.

That's really a qmail configuration problem. That was the name of 
the first server. The current server is taz2.fiberhosting.com.

I'll see if I can find it in the qmail configuration. If not, I'll add a 
CNAME for it.

Dear Friend

You can download harbour from
http://www.harbour-project.org
http://www.conex.com.br/user/culik

Look for the download page.

Libraries can be found on the download page.

Dont forget you need an C compiler
For win32, use Borland C++ 5.5 its free

Message-ID: <200106131700.0000002L@Internet>

Would it be possible for whoever set up the original ONElist mailing
lists for Harbour (you know, the lists that became the eGroups mailing
lists for Harbour and then the Yahoo! mailing lists for Harbour) to get
those mailing lists shut down permanently?

Somebody sent an email to Harbour@eGroups.com the other day, which
resulted in a digest being sent from Harbour@Yahoogroups.com. This
appears to have caused an induhvidual to set up an auto-responder that
sends a complaint to the list every time this induhvidual gets a digest.
So now this induhvidual gets a digest every day with nothing in it but
his own message:

Which AltaVista's BabelFish translates as "Received, now single lack
that reads it..."

So somebody either needs to terminate the ancient Yahoo mailing lists
with extreme prejudice or clue this induhvidual in regarding his
self-sustaining perpetual loop.

Patrick,

Do you think we could have a "home page" link for each of us on the Crew
List?

Mine is <http://members.dingoblue.net.au/~mabster>

Cheers,
Matt

ps. Just looking at the "newsite" again. Man, it's awesome.

Subject: [HarbourTalk] More passport fun and games
Message-ID: <20010627082939.G2425@hagbard.davep.org>

Further to the harbour developer's mailing list discussion about MS'
<URL:http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/06/26/2050205&mode=thread> should
look interesting to either side of the debate.

As usual with slashdot, the reader comments are generally a waste of time
unless you set your filter really high. However, this one comment had me
chuckling into my coffee:

That would probably have made more sense if, as I'd intended, it had said
"MS' passport service". For some reason "passport service" disappeared from
the text. Most odd.
