  <div>Clipper is a trademark of Computer Associates and will often be referred to as CA-Cl*pper within Harbour documents. Regardless of this variant, Clipper is recognized as Computer Associates' trademark.</div>
  <div>Harbour is a free software compiler for the xBase superset language often referred to as Clipper (the language that is implemented by the compiler Clipper). The goal of Harbour is to produce a cross platform CA-Cl*pper compatible compiler.</div>
  <div>The Harbour website is at <a href="https://vszakats.github.io/harbour-core/">https://vszakats.github.io/harbour-core/</a>. If you have any problems with this copy of Harbour please visit our web site and ensure that you are using the latest release.</div>
  <div>If you are reading this file as part of a source distribution of Harbour you probably want to start by reading <code>dirstruc.txt</code> because this is your map to the Harbour source directories.</div>
  <div>Harbour is a superset of Clipper and is backwards compatible with nearly 100% of all Clipper 5.2x or 5.3 code. Most Clipper S'87 code will also compile and run fine, but may require some modifications to run well.</div>

  <div><strong>Known incompatibilities between Harbour and CA-Cl*pper compilers  </strong></div>
  <div><hr></div>
  <div>NOTE:</div>
  <div>If you want a 100% compatible runtime libraries then you have to define HB_CLP_STRICT, using 'HB_USER_CFLAGS=-DHB_CLP_STRICT', then rebuild.</div>
  <div><strong>Passing an undeclared variable by the reference </strong></div>
  <div><hr></div>
  <div>The CA-Cl*pper compiler uses the special opcode PUSHP to pass a reference to an undeclared variable ( '@' operator ). The type of passed variable is checked at runtime (field or memvar). However, field variables cannot be passed by reference. This means that CA-Cl*pper checks the memvar variable only and doesn't look for a field. This is the reason why the Harbour compiler uses the usual PUSHMEMVARREF opcode in such cases. Notice that the runtime behavior is the same in CA-Cl*pper and in Harbour - only the generated opcodes are different.</div>
  <div>Handling of object messages</div>
  <div><hr></div>
  <div>The HB_CLP_STRICT setting determines the way chained send messages are handled.</div>
  <div>For example, the following code:</div>
  <div>a:b( COUNT() ):c += 1</div>
  <div>will be handled as:</div>
  <div>a:b( COUNT() ):c := a:b( COUNT() ):c + 1</div>
  <div>in strict CA-Cl*pper compatibility mode and</div>
  <div>temp := a:b( COUNT() ), temp:c += 1</div>
  <div>in non-strict mode.</div>
  <div>In practice, CA-Cl*pper will call the COUNT() function two times: the first time before addition and the second one after addition. In Harbour, COUNT() will be called only once, before addition.</div>
  <div>The Harbour (non-strict) method is:</div>
  <div>1) faster 2) it guarantees that the same instance variable of the same object will be changed</div>
  <div>(See also: src/compiler/expropt.c)</div>
  <div><strong>Initialization of static variables      </strong></div>
  <div><hr></div>
  <div>There is a difference in the initialization of static variables that are initialized with a codeblock that refers to a local variable. For example:</div>
<pre>
PROCEDURE Main()
   LOCAL MyLocalVar
   STATIC s_MyStaticVar := {|| MyLocalVar }
   MyLocalVar := 0
   ? Eval( s_MyStaticVar )
   RETURN
</pre>
  <div>The above code compiles fine in CA-Cl*pper, but it generates a runtime error Error/BASE 1132 Bound error: array access Called form (b)STATICS$(0)</div>
  <div>In Harbour this code generates a compile time error: Error E0009 Illegal variable (b) initializer: 'MyLocalVar'</div>
  <div>Both CA-Cl*pper and Harbour are handling all local variables used in a codeblock in a special way: they are detached from the local stack of function/procedure where they are declared. This allows access to these variables after the exit from a function/procedure. However, all static variables are initialized in a separate procedure ('STATICS$' in CA-Cl*pper and '(_INITSTATICS)' in Harbour) before the main procedure and before all INIT procedures. The local variables don't exist on the eval stack when static variables are initialized, so they cannot be detached.</div>

  <div><strong>Language extensions:</strong> <hr></div>
  <div>* Class generation and management.</div>
  <div>CA-Cl*pper only allowed creation of objects from a few standard classes.</div>
  <div>In Harbour, you can create your own classes--complete with Methods, Instance Variables, Class Variables and Inheritance. Entire applications can be designed and coded in Object Oriented style.</div>
  <div>* @&lt;FunctionName&gt;()</div>
  <div>Returns the pointer (address) to a function.</div>
  <div>The returned value is not useful to application-level programming, but is used at a low level to implement object oriented coding. (Internally, a class method is a static function and there is no symbol for it, so it is accessed via its address).</div>
  <div>* Class HBGetList</div>
  <div>Object oriented support for GetLists management.</div>
  <div>* ProcName() support for class Method names.</div>
  <div>Class Methods can be retrieved from the call stack.</div>
  <div>* Memory() has new return values.</div>
  <div>See hbmemory.ch</div>
  <div>* Transform() &rarr; new function in format string</div>
  <div>@0      Make a zero padded string out of the number.</div>

  <div>New function that converts a yyyymmdd string to a Date value.</div>
  <div>* Optional Compile Time STRONG TYPE declaration (and compile time TYPE</div>
  <div>MISMATCH warnings)</div>
  <div>Example: LOCAL/STATIC Var AS ...</div>
  <div>* The Harbour debugger provides new interesting classes:</div>
  <div>- Class TDbWindow could be the foundation for a generic multi-platform</div>
  <div>- Class TForm</div>
  <div>- Class TDbMenu implement both pulldown and popup menus.</div>
  <div><strong>RTL enhanced functionality:</strong> <hr></div>
  <div>- hb_vfDirSpace( &lt;nDir&gt;, &lt;nType&gt; )</div>

<h4>The Garbage Collector</h4>
<div class="d-ol">
  <div>Readme for Harbour Garbage Collect Feature</div>
</div>
<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>The garbage collector uses the following logic: - first collect all memory allocations that can cause garbage; - next scan all variables if these memory blocks are still referenced.</div>
  <div>Notice that only arrays, objects and codeblocks are collected because these are the only datatypes that can cause self-references ( a[ 1 ] := a ) or circular references ( a[ 1 ] := b; b[ 1 ] := c; c[ 1 ] := a ) that cannot be properly deallocated by simple reference counting.</div>
  <div>Since all variables in Harbour are stored inside some available tables (the eval stack, memvars table and array of static variables) then checking if the reference is still alive is quite easy and doesn't require any special treatment during memory allocation. Additionaly the garbage collector is scanning some internal data used by Harbour objects implementation that also stores some values that can contain memory references. These data are used to initialize class instance variables and are stored in class shared variables.</div>
  <div>In special cases when the value of a Harbour variable is stored internally in some static area (at C or assembler level), the garbage collector will be not able to scan such values since it doesn't know their location. This could cause some memory blocks to be released prematurely. To prevent the premature deallocation of such memory blocks the static data have to store a pointer to the value created with hb_itemNew() function. Example:</div>
  <div>static HB_ITEM s_item; /* this item can be released by the GC */</div>
  <div>static PHB_ITEM pItem; /* this item will be maintained correctly */ pItem = hb_itemNew( hb_param( 1, IT_BLOCK ) );</div>
  <div>However, scanning of all variables can be a time consuming operation. It requires that all allocated arrays have to be traversed through all their elements to find more arrays. Also all codeblocks are scanned for detached local variables they are referencing. For this reason, looking for unreferenced memory blocks is performed during the idle states.</div>
  <div>The idle state is a state when there is no real application code executed. For example, the user code is stopped for 0.1 of a second during Inkey( 0.1 ) - Harbour is checking the keyboard only during this time. It leaves however quite enough time for many other background tasks. One such background task can be looking for unreferenced memory blocks.</div>
  <div>Allocating memory <hr></div>
  <div>The garbage collector collects memory blocks allocated with hb_gcAlloc() function calls. Memory allocated by hb_gcAlloc() should be released with hb_gcFree() function.</div>
  <div>The garbage collecting <hr></div>
  <div>During scanning of unreferenced memory the GC is using a mark &amp; sweep algorithm. This is done in three steps:</div>
  <div>1) mark all memory blocks allocated by the GC with unused flag;</div>
  <div>2) sweep (scan) all known places and clear unused flag for memory blocks that are referenced there;</div>
  <div>3) finalize collecting by deallocation of all memory blocks that are still marked as unused and that are not locked.</div>
  <div>To speed things up, the mark step is simplified by swapping the meaning of the unused flag. After deallocation of unused blocks all still alive memory blocks are marked with the same 'used' flag so we can reverse the meaning of this flag to 'unused' state in the next collecting. All new or unlocked memory blocks are automatically marked as 'unused' using the current flag, which assures that all memory blocks are marked with the same flag before the sweep step will start. See hb_gcCollectAll() and hb_gcItemRef()</div>
  <div>Calling the garbage collector from Harbour code <hr></div>
  <div>The garbage collector can be called directly from the Harbour code. This is usefull in situations where there is no idle states available or the application is working in the loop with no user interaction and there is many memory allocations. See hb_gcAll() for explanation of how to call this function from your Harbour code.</div>

<h4>The idle states</h4>

  <div>Read me file for Idle States</div>
</div>
<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>The idle state is the state of the Harbour virtual machine when it waits for the user input from the keyboard or the mouse. The idle state is entered during Inkey() calls currently. All applications that don't use Inkey() function call can signal the idle states with the call of hb_idleState() function (or hb_idleState() on C level).</div>
  <div>During idle states the virtual machine calls the garbage collector and it can call user defined actions (background tasks). It also releases the CPU time slices for some poor platforms that are not smart enough to detect it automatically.</div>
  <div>For defining the background tasks see the hb_idleAdd() and hb_idleDel() functions.</div>
  <div>For direct call for background actions see hb_idleState() function.</div>

  <div>ASort() sort all or part of a given array.

  <div>If &lt;bSort&gt; is specified, it is used to handle the sorting order. With each time the block is evaluate, two array elements are passed to the code block, and &lt;bSort&gt; must return a logical value that state if those elements are in order (.T.) or not (.F.). Using this block you can sort multidimensional array, descending orders or even (but why would you want to do that) sort array that contain different data type.</div>

  <div>Sets the current color scheme, using color pairs in the sequence &quot;&lt;standard&gt;, &lt;enhanced&gt;, &lt;border&gt;, &lt;background&gt;, &lt;unselected&gt;&quot;. Each color pair uses the format &quot;&lt;foreground&gt;/&lt;background&gt;&quot;. The color codes are space or &quot;N&quot; for black, &quot;B&quot; for blue, &quot;G&quot; for green, &quot;BG&quot; for Cyan, &quot;R&quot; for red, &quot;RB&quot; for magenta, &quot;GR&quot; for brown, &quot;W&quot; for white, &quot;N+&quot; for gray, &quot;B+&quot; for bright blue, &quot;G+&quot; for bright green, &quot;BG+&quot; for bright cyan, &quot;R+&quot; for bright red, &quot;RB+&quot; for bright magenta, &quot;GR+&quot; for yellow, and &quot;W+&quot; for bright white. Special codes are &quot;I&quot; for inverse video, &quot;U&quot; for underline on a monochrome monitor (blue on a color monitor), and &quot;X&quot; for blank. The default color is &quot;W/N,N/W,N,N,N/W&quot;.</div>
  <div>_SET_CONFIRM     &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>If enabled, an exit key must be pressed to leave a GET. If disabled, which is the default, typing past the end will leave a GET.</div>
  <div>_SET_CONSOLE     &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>If enabled, which is the default, all screen output goes to the screen. When disabled, screen output is suppressed (Note: This setting does not affect OutStd() or OutErr()).</div>
  <div>_SET_CURSOR      &lt;nCursorType&gt;</div>
  <div>If enabled, which is the default, the cursor is displayed on screen. If disabled, the screen cursor is hidden.</div>
  <div>_SET_DATEFORMAT  &lt;cDateFormat&gt;</div>
  <div>Sets the default date format for display, date input, and date conversion. Defaults to American (&quot;mm/dd/yy&quot;). Other formats include ANSI (&quot;yy.mm.dd&quot;), British (&quot;dd/mm/yy&quot;), French (&quot;dd/mm/yy&quot;), German (&quot;dd.mm.yy&quot;), Italian (&quot;dd-mm-yy&quot;), Japan (&quot;yy/mm/dd&quot;), and USA (&quot;mm-dd-yy&quot;). SET CENTURY modifies the date format. SET CENTURY ON replaces the &quot;y&quot;s with &quot;YYYY&quot;. SET CENTURY OFF replaces the &quot;y&quot;s with &quot;YY&quot;.</div>
  <div>_SET_DEBUG       &lt;lStatus&gt;</div>
  <div>When set to .T., pressing Alt+D activates the debugger. When set to .F., which is the default, Alt+D can be read by Inkey(). (Also affected by AltD(1) and AltD(0))</div>
  <div>_SET_DECIMALS    &lt;nNumberOfDecimals&gt;</div>
  <div>Sets the number of decimal digits to use when displaying printing numeric values when SET FIXED is ON. Defaults to 2. If SET FIXED is OFF, then SET DECIMALS is only used to determine the number of decimal digits to use after using Exp(), Log(), Sqrt(), or division. Other math operations may adjust the number of decimal digits that the result will display. Note: This never affects the precision of a number. Only the display format is affected.</div>
  <div>_SET_DEFAULT     &lt;cDefaultDirectory&gt;</div>
  <div>Sets the default directory in which to open, create and check for files. Defaults to current directory (blank).</div>

  <div>_SET_DEVICE      &lt;cDeviceName&gt;</div>
  <div>Selects the output device for DevOut(). When set to &quot;PRINTER&quot;, all output is sent to the printer device or file set by _SET_PRINTFILE. When set to anything else, all output is sent to the screen. Defaults to &quot;SCREEN&quot;.</div>
  <div>_SET_EOF         &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>Defaults to FALSE on UN*X, but defaults to TRUE on everything else. If set to FALSE, then Chr( 26 ) does not get written when using COPY TO DELIMITED, COPY TO SDF, or when closing any of the various text files that are created using various SET values. [This is a Harbour extension]</div>
  <div>_SET_EPOCH       &lt;nYear&gt;</div>
  <div>Determines how to handle the conversion of 2-digit years to 4 digit years. When a 2-digit year is greater than or equal to the year part of the epoch, the century part of the epoch is added to the year. When a 2-digit year is less than the year part of the epoch, the century part of the epoch is incremented and added to the year. The default epoch is 1900, which converts all 2-digit years to 19xx. Example: If the epoch is set to 1950, 2-digit years in the range from 50 to 99 get converted to 19xx and 2-digit years in the range 00 to 49 get converted to 20xx.</div>
  <div>_SET_ESCAPE      &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>

  <div>Determines which events Inkey() will respond to. INKEY_MOVE allows mouse movement events. INKEY_LDOWN allows the left mouse button down click. INKEY_LUP allows the left mouse button up click. INKEY_RDOWN allows the right mouse button down click. INKEY_RUP allows the right mouse button up clock. INKEY_KEYBOARD allows keyboard keystrokes. INKEY_ALL allows all of the preceding events. Events may be combined (e.g., using INKEY_LDOWN + INKEY_RUP will allow left mouse button down clicks and right mouse button up clicks). The default is INKEY_KEYBOARD.</div>
  <div>_SET_EXACT       &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>When enabled, all string comparisons other than &quot;==&quot; exclude trailing spaces when checking for equality. When disabled, which is the default, all string comparisons other than &quot;==&quot; treat two strings as equal if the right hand string is &quot;&quot; or if the right hand string is shorter than or the same length as the left hand string and all of the characters in the right hand string match the corresponding characters in the left hand string.</div>
  <div>_SET_EXCLUSIVE   &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>When enabled, which is the default, all database files are opened in exclusive mode. When disabled, all database files are opened in shared mode. Note: The EXCLUSIVE and SHARED clauses of the USE command can be used to override this setting.</div>
  <div>_SET_EXIT        &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>Toggles the use of Uparrow and Dnarrow as READ exit keys. Specifying true (.T.) enables them as exit keys, and false (.F.) disables them. Used internally by the ReadExit() function.</div>
  <div>_SET_EXTRA       &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>QUESTION: What is this for? It does not affect _SET_EXTRAFILE in CA-Cl*pper!</div>
  <div>_SET_EXTRAFILE   &lt;cFileName&gt;             &lt;lAdditive&gt;</div>
  <div>When set, creates or opens file to write QOut() and QQOut() output to. If &lt;lAdditive&gt; is TRUE and the file already exists, the file is opened and positioned at end of file. Otherwise, the file is created. If a file is already opened, it is closed before the new file is opened or created (even if it is the same file). The default file extension is &quot;.prn&quot;. There is no default file name. Call with an empty string to close the file.</div>
  <div>_SET_FIXED       &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>When enabled, all numeric values will be displayed and printed with the number of decimal digits set by SET DECIMALS, unless a PICTURE clause is used. When disabled, which is the default, the number of decimal digits that are displayed depends upon a variety of factors. See _SET_DECIMALS for more.</div>
  <div>_SET_INSERT      &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>When enabled, characters typed in a GET or MEMOEDIT are inserted. When disabled, which is the default, characters typed in a GET or MEMOEDIT overwrite. Note: This setting can also be toggled between on and off by pressing the Insert key during a GET or MEMOEDIT.</div>
  <div>_SET_INTENSITY   &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>When enabled, which is the default, GETs and PROMPTs are displayed using the enhanced color setting. When disabled, GETs and PROMPTs are displayed using the standard color setting.</div>
  <div>_SET_LANGUAGE    &lt;cLanguageID&gt;</div>
  <div>Specifies the language to be used for Harbour messages. [This is a Harbour extension]</div>
  <div>_SET_MARGIN      &lt;nColumns&gt;</div>
  <div>Sets the left margin for all printed output. The default value is 0. Note: PCol() reflects the printer's column position including the margin (e.g., SET MARGIN TO 5 followed by DevPos(5, 10) makes PCol() return 15).</div>
  <div>_SET_MBLOCKSIZE &lt;nMemoBlockSize&gt;</div>
  <div>TODO: Document</div>
  <div>_SET_MCENTER     &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>

  <div>_SET_PRINTER     &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>If enabled, QOut() and QQOut() write to the screen and to a file, provided that a file has been opened or created with _SET_ALTFILE. If disabled, which is the default, QOut() and QQOut() only write to the screen (and/or to the ALTFILE).</div>
  <div>_SET_PRINTFILE   &lt;cFileName&gt;             &lt;lAdditive&gt;</div>
  <div>When set, creates or opens file to write QOut(), QQOut() and DevOut() output to. If &lt;lAdditive&gt; is TRUE and the file already exists, the file is opened and positioned at end of file. Otherwise, the file is created. If a file is already opened, it is closed before the new file is opened or created (even if it is the same file). The default file extension is &quot;.prn&quot;. The default file name is &quot;PRN&quot;, which maps to the default printer device. Call with an empty string to close the file.</div>
  <div>_SET_SCOREBOARD  &lt;lFlag&gt; | &lt;cOnOff&gt;</div>
  <div>When enabled, which is the default, READ and MEMOEDIT display status messages on screen row 0. When disabled, READ and MEMOEDIT status messages are suppressed.</div>

  <div>This function opens a file expressed as &lt;cFile&gt; and returns a file handle to be used with other low-level file functions. The value of &lt;nMode&gt; represents the status of the file to be opened; the default value is 0. The file open modes are as follows:</div>
  <div class="d-t d-t1">
  <div> nMode          Meaning</div>
  <div> FO_READ        Read only</div>

  <div>hb_inetConnect() uses &quot;gethostbyname&quot; C system call to find the network address of the specified server; this means that this call is an hybrid function doing both a DNS scan and a TCP/IP connection. hb_inetConnect() is not thread safe, and the program must take care that two hb_inetConnect() functions are never called at the same moment from two different threads (or that hb_inetGetHosts() is not called in the same moment as an hb_inetConnect()).</div>
  <div>The second version of this function accepts a pre-built socket as a parameter. This allows to kill asyncronously a thread waiting for hb_inetConnect() to connect, and then cleaning up the leftover socket data. Also, it is possible to give timeout to the given SOCKET, but this timeout will be used only in the connection phase, after that the network address resolution is completed. Use hb_inetGetHosts() and hb_inetConnectIP() for a finer timeout control. On error, the error of the returned socket is set. The error could be due to unavailable name resolving service, host name not valid, host address not reachable and host reachable but port not open.</div>

  <div>If an error occurs, or if the stream is closed before a CRLF is read, the function returns nothing and sets the socket error.</div>
  <div>The returned string does not contain the trailing CRLF sequence, so an empty line is effectively returned as an empty string.</div>
  <div>If the nBytesRead parameter is given, it will contain the number of bytes read from the socket, including the CRLF sequence, so that in normal conditions, nResult will report a count equal to the length of the returned string plus 2. nBytesRead will be 0 if stream is closed before a CRLF sequence is read, and will be -1 on error.</div>
  <div>An optional nMaxLength parameter can be given to allow a maximum character count before the data is returned anyway. If this number is reached before a CRLF sequence is encountered, nBytesRead will contain the value one.</div>
  <div>Finally, a nBufSize parameter can be given. If not, memory allocation will be increased by discrete amounts of 80 bytes. The programmer can provide here a different allocation strategy (e.g. setting nBufSize equal to nMaxLength, memory for reading the line will be allocated only once, at the beginning of the function).</div>

  <div>If the computer on which hb_inetServer() is called has more than one logical interface (e.g. one network card, one loopback and one PPP address), cBindAddr can be specified to select only one of these interfaces to accept connections for this process. This is useful when a server is present on two networks, and the service is to be available only in one of them. Also, the same port on other addresses is left free to be used, so you can have different server programs running for different networks but managing the same service. For example, an FTP server available to the internal network could be radically different from an FTP server available for the internet.</div>
  <div>nListenLimit is the number of incoming connections accepted by kernel before the kernel has the chance to report them to the application program. If the sockets receive nListenLimit connections before accepting them all, the nListenLimit + 1 connection will be notified to be &quot;busy&quot; by the kernel.

  <div>It is used to import data from other sources to our database.</div>
  <div>Note: hb_MemoRead() does not use the settings SET DEFAULT or SET PATH to search for &lt;cFileName&gt;. It searches for &lt;cFileName&gt; in the current directory.</div>
  <div>Over a network, hb_MemoRead() attempts to open &lt;cFileName&gt; in read-only mode and shared.  If the file is used in mode exclusive by another process, the function will returns a null string (&quot;&quot;).</div>
  <div>hb_MemoRead() vs MemoRead(): hb_MemoRead() is identical to MemoRead() except it won't truncate the last byte (on non-UNIX compatible systems) if it's a EOF char.</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>StrZero() is a numeric conversion function that converts numeric values to character strings. It is commonly used to concatenate numeric values to character strings. StrZero() has applications displaying numbers, creating codes such as part numbers from numeric values, and creating index keys that combine numeric and character data.</div>
  <div>StrZero() is like Transform(), which formats numeric values as character strings using a mask instead of length and decimal specifications.</div>
  <div>The inverse of StrZero() is Val(), which converts character numbers to numerics.</div>
  <div>*  If &lt;nLength&gt; is less than the number of whole number digits in</div>
  <div>&lt;nNumber&gt;, Str() returns asterisks instead of the number.</div>
  <div>*  If &lt;nLength&gt; is less than the number of decimal digits</div>
  <div>required for the decimal portion of the returned string, Harbour rounds the number to the available number of decimal places.</div>
  <div>*  If &lt;nLength&gt; is specified but &lt;nDecimals&gt; is omitted (no</div>
  <div>decimal places), the return value is rounded to an integer.</div>
  <div>The StrZero() function was part of the CA-Cl*pper samples.</div>
</div>
<div class="d-d">Example(s)</div>
<pre class="d-ex">
? StrZero( 10, 6, 2 )  // &quot;010.00&quot;
? StrZero( -10, 8, 2 )  // &quot;-0010.00&quot;

  <div>This function returns &lt;xExpression&gt; in the format of the picture expression passed to the function as &lt;cTemplate&gt;.</div>
  <div>Their are two components that can make up &lt;cTemplate&gt; : a function string and a template string. Function strings are those functions that globally tell what the format of &lt;xExpression&gt; should be. These functions are represented by a single character precede by the @ symbol.</div>
  <div>There are a couple of rules to follow when using function strings and template strings:</div>
  <div>- First, a single space must fall between the function template</div>
  <div>and the template string if they are used in conjunction with one another.</div>
  <div>- Second, if both components make up the value of &lt;cTemplate&gt;, the</div>
  <div>function string must precede the template string. Otherwise, the function string may appear with out the template string and vice versa.</div>
  <div>The table below shows the possible function strings available with the Transform() function.</div>
  <div class="d-t">
  <div>@B   Left justify the string within the format.</div>
  <div>@C   Issue a CR after format is numbers are positive.</div>

  <div>&lt;nEvents&gt; is an optional mask of input events that are to be enabled. If omitted, defaults to hb_set.HB_SET_EVENTMASK. Valid input masks are in inkey.ch and are explained below. It is recommended that the mask names be used rather than their numeric values, in case the numeric values change in future releases of Harbour. To allow more than one type of input event, simply add the various mask names together.</div>

<div class="d-d">Returns</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>0 in case of timeout with no input event, otherwise returns a value in the range -47 to 386 for keyboard events or the range 1001 to 1007 for mouse events. Mouse events and non-printable keyboard events are represented by the K_&lt;event&gt; values listed in inkey.ch. Keyboard event return codes in the range 32 through 127 are equivalent to the printable ASCII character set. Keyboard event return codes in the range 128 through 255 are assumed to be printable, but results may vary based on hardware and nationality. If HB_INKEY_EXTENDED mode is used, then the return value for keyboard events ranges from 1 through 767 and 1077 through 1491, although not all codes are used.</div>
  <div>Extended key codes consist of the PC keyboard scan code and one or more offset values. If no keyboard modifier was used, then HB_INKEY_NONE is added. The Alt key adds HB_INKEY_ALT, the Ctrl key adds HB_INKEY_CTRL, the Shift key adds HB_INKEY_SHIFT, and enhanced keys (KeyPad+/ and CursorPad keys) add HB_INKEY_ENHANCED. For example, F1 is scan code 59, so if you just press F1, you get key code 315, but Alt+F1 gives 443, Ctrl+F1 gives 571, and Shift+ F1 gives 699. And NumPad+/ gives 1077, 1205, 1333, and 1461. At this time, the only value that can combine with other values is HB_INKEY_ENHANCED (i.e., there are no Alt+Ctl combinations, etc.)</div>
  <div>Note: The extended key code set is larger than the normal key code set. As a result, if you switch between the normal and extended modes, you need to be aware that some codes get translated into a zero in normal mode (because there is no corresponding code in normal mode) and that these codes get removed from the keyboard input buffer in normal mode and you won't be able to go back and fetch them later in extended mode.</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>This function returns a string which represents the data type of the argument. The argument can be any valid Harbour expression. If there is a syntax error in passed expression then &quot;UE&quot; is returned. If there is a call for any non-reserved Harbour function then &quot;UI&quot; is returned (in other words there is no call for passed UDF function during a data type determination - this is CA-Cl*pper compatible behavior). Additionally if requested user defined function is not linked into executable then &quot;U&quot; is returned.</div>
  <div>The data type of expression is checked by invoking a macro compiler and by evaluation of generated code (if there is no syntax errors). This causes that Type() cannot determine a type of local or static variables - only symbols visible at runtime can be checked.</div>
  <div>Notice the subtle difference between TYPE and VALTYPE functions. ValType() function doesn't call a macro compiler - it simply checks the type of passed argument of any type. Type() requires a string argument with a valid Harbour expression - the data type of this expression is returned.</div>

  <div>CLASS creates a class from which you can create objects.

  <div>A program uses a Class by calling the Class Constructor, usually the New() method, to create an object. That object is usually assigned to a variable, which is used to access the VAR elements and methods.</div>

  <div>The MESSAGE command is a seldom-used feature that lets you re-route a call to a method with a different name. This can be necessary if a method name conflicts with a public function that needs to be called from within the class methods.</div>
  <div>For example, your app may have a public function called BeginPaint() that is used in painting windows. It would also be natural to have a Window class method called :BeginPaint() that the application can call. But within the class method you would not be able to call the public function because internally methods are based on static functions (which hide public functions of the same name).</div>
  <div>The MESSAGE command lets you create the true method with a different name (::xBeginPaint()), yet still allow the ::BeginPaint() syntax to call ::xBeginPaint().  This is then free to call the public function BeginPaint().</div>

<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>Methods are &quot;class functions&quot; which do the work of the class. All methods must be defined in the class header between the CLASS and ENDCLASS commands.  If the body of a method is not fully defined here, the full body is written below the ENDCLASS command using this syntax:</div>
  <div>METHOD &lt;MethodName&gt;( [&lt;params,...&gt;] ) CLASS &lt;ClassName&gt;</div>
  <div>Methods can reference the current object with the keyword &quot;Self:&quot; or its shorthand version &quot;::&quot;.</div>
  <div>CLAUSES:</div>
  <div>CONSTRUCTOR  Defines a special method Class Constructor method,</div>
  <div>used to create objects.  This is usually the New() method. Constructors always return the new object.</div>
  <div>INLINE       Fast and easy to code, INLINE lets you define the</div>
  <div>code for the method immediately within the definition of the Class. Any methods not declared INLINE or BLOCK must be fully defined after the ENDCLASS command. The &lt;Code,...&gt; following INLINE receives a parameter of Self. If you need to receive more parameters, use the BLOCK clause instead.</div>
  <div>BLOCK        Use this clause when you want to declare fast 'inline'</div>
  <div>methods that need parameters. The first parameter to &lt;CodeBlock&gt; must be Self, as in:</div>
  <div>METHOD       &lt;MethodName&gt; BLOCK {| Self, &lt;arg1&gt;, &lt;arg2&gt;, ..., &lt;argN&gt; | ... }</div>
  <div>EXTERN       If an external function does what the method needs,</div>
  <div>use this clause to make an optimized call to that function directly.</div>
  <div>SETGET       For calculated Data. The name of the method can be</div>
  <div>manipulated like a Data element to Set or Get a value.</div>
  <div>VIRTUAL      Methods that do nothing. Useful for Base classes where</div>
  <div>the child class will define the method's behavior, or when you are first creating and testing a Class.</div>
  <div>OPERATOR     Operator Overloading for classes.</div>
  <div>See example tests/testop.prg for details.</div>
  <div>CLASS &lt;ClassName&gt;</div>
  <div>Use this syntax only for defining a full method after the ENDCLASS command.</div>

<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>This command can direct all output that is not controlled by the @...SAY command and the DevPos() and DevOut() functions to the printer. If specified, the condition &lt;lPrinter&gt; toggles the printer ON if a logical true (.T.) and OFF if a logical false (.F.). If no argument is specified in the command, the alternate file (if one is open) is closed, or the device is reselected and the PRINTER option is turned OFF.</div>
  <div>If a device is specified in &lt;cPrinter&gt;, the output will be directed to that device instead of to the PRINTER. A specified device may be a literal string or a variable, as long as the variable is enclosed in parentheses. For a network, do not use a trailing colon when redirecting to a device.</div>
  <div>If an alternate file is specified, &lt;cPrinter&gt; becomes the name of a file that will contain the output. If no file extension is specified an extension of .prn will be defaulted to.</div>
  <div>If the ADDITIVE clause is specified, the information will be appended to the end of the specified output file. Otherwise, a new file will be created with the specified name (or an existing file will first be cleared) and the information will then be appended to the file. The default is to create a new file.</div>

<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>The function Atn2() is an alternate function for calculating the arcus tangent, Atn2(x,y) = Atan(x/y). It takes two arguments, the sine and the cosine of the angle that should be calculated. Thus, in contrast to the Atan() function, Atn2() can distinguish whether the sine or the cosine has a negative sign (or both being positive or negative), so that the return value can be between -Pi() and Pi() and covers the full angle. The return value is given in radiants (full angle equals 2*Pi - see DToR() if you need to convert it into degress).</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>The CharSort() function sorts the characters within a string &lt;cString&gt;. With the parameters &lt;nIgnoreCharacters&gt; and &lt;nSortLength&gt;, you can determine that only the substring from position &lt;nIgnoreCharacters&gt;+1 to position &lt;nIgnoreCharacters&gt;+&lt;nSortLength&gt; within &lt;cString&gt; should be sorted. The sorting algorithm is determined with the other parameters. &lt;nElementLength&gt; specifies the length of one element, i.e. there are &lt;nSortLength&gt;/&lt;nElementLength&gt; elements that are sorted. Note that surplus characters are not sorted but stay at their position. To do the sorting, the function uses the Quicksort algorithm implemented in the C-lib qsort() function. This algorithm needs to know how to compare and order two elements. This is done by comparing the ASCII values of a substring within each element. This substring is determined by the parameters &lt;nElementOffset&gt; and &lt;nCompareLength&gt; and the order by &lt;lDescending&gt;. By setting the CSetRef() switch to .T., one can omit the return value of the function, but one must then pass &lt;cString&gt; by reference.</div>

</div>
<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>The CharXor() function constructs a new string from the two strings passed as parameters. To do this, it combines the ASCII values of the corresponding characters of both strings with a bitwise XOR-operation and places a character in the resulting string whose ASCII value equals to the result of that operation. If the first string is passed by reference, the resulting string is stored in &lt;cString1&gt;, too. By setting the CSetRef()-switch to .T., the return value can be omitted. If &lt;cString2&gt; is shorter than &lt;cString1&gt; and the last character of &lt;cString2&gt; has been processed, the function restarts with the first character of &lt;cString2&gt;.</div>

</div>
<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>The StrDiff() functions calculates the so called &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Levensthein&quot; distance of two strings. This distance is a measure for the number of single character replace/insert/delete operations (so called &quot;point mutations&quot;) required to transform &lt;cString1&gt; into &lt;cString2&gt; and its value will be the smallest sum of the penalty points of the required operations.</div>
  <div>Be aware that this function is both quite time - O(Len(cString1)*Len(cString2)) - and memory consuming - O((Len(cString1)+1)*(Len(cString2)+1)*sizeof(int)) - so keep the strings as short as possible. E.g., on common 32-bit systems (sizeof(int) == 4), calling StrDiff() with two strings of 1024 bytes in length will consume 4 MiB of memory. To not impose unneeded restrictions, the function will only check if (Len(cString1)+1)*(Len(cString2)+1)*sizeof(int) &lt;= UINT_MAX, although allocing UINT_MAX bytes will not work on most systems. If this simple check fails, -1 is returned.</div>
  <div>Also, be aware that there can be an overflow when the penalty points are summed up: Assuming that the number of transformation operations is in the order of Max(Len(cString1), Len(cString2)), the penalty point sum, that is internally stored in an &quot;int&quot; variable, is in the order of (Max(Len(cString1), Len(cString2))*Max(nReplacementPenalty, nDeletionPenalty, nInsertionPentaly). The StrDiff() does not do an overflow check due to time performance reasons. Future versions of StrDiff() could use a type different to &quot;int&quot; to store the penalty point sum to save memory or to avoid overflows.</div>
  <div>The function is aware of the settings done by SetAtLike(), that means that the wildchar character is considered equal to ALL characters.</div>

<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>The TokenInit() function initializes a token environment. A token environment is the information about how a string is to be tokenized. This information is created in the process of tokenization of the string &lt;cString&gt; - equal to the one used in the Token() function with the help of the &lt;cTokenizer&gt; and &lt;nSkipWidth&gt; parameters.</div>
  <div>This token environment can be very useful when large strings have to be tokenized since the tokenization has to take place only once whereas the Token() function must always start the tokenizing process from scratch.</div>
  <div>Unlike CT3, this function provides two mechanisms of storing the resulting token environment. If a variable is passed by reference as 4th parameter, the token environment is stored in this variable, otherwise the global token environment is used. Do not modify the token environment string directly !</div>
  <div>Additionally, a counter is stored in the token environment, so that the tokens can successivly be obtained. This counter is first set to 1. When the TokenInit() function is called without a string a tokenize, the counter of either the global environment or the environment given by reference in the 4th parameter is rewind to 1.</div>
  <div>Additionally, unlike CT3, TokenInit() does not need the string &lt;cString&gt; to be passed by reference, since one must provide the string in calls to TokenNext() again.</div>
</div>
<div class="d-d">Example(s)</div>
<pre class="d-ex">
TokenInit( cString )             // tokenize the string &lt;cString&gt; with default
                                 // rules and store the token environment globally
                                 // and eventually delete an old global TE
TokenInit( @cString )            // no difference in result, but eventually faster,
                                 // since the string must not be copied
TokenInit()                      // rewind counter of global TE to 1
TokenInit( &quot;1,2,3&quot;, &quot;,&quot; , 1 )    // tokenize constant string, store in global TE
TokenInit( cString, , 1, @cTE1 ) // tokenize cString and store TE in
                                 // cTE1 only without overriding global TE
TokenInit( cString, , 1, cTE1 )  // tokenize cString and store TE in
                                 // GLOBAL TE since 4th parameter is

  <div>With TokenNext(), the tokens determined with the TokenInit() functions can be retrieved.

  <div>If the 2nd parameter, &lt;nToken&gt; is given, TokenNext() simply returns the &lt;nToken&gt;th token without manipulating the TE counter. Otherwise the token pointed to by the TE counter is returned and the counter is incremented by one. Like this, a simple loop with TokenEnd() can be used to retrieve all tokens of a string successivly.</div>
  <div>Note that &lt;cString&gt; does not have to be the same used in TokenInit(), so that one can do a &quot;correlational tokenization&quot;, i.e. tokenize a string as if it was another! E.G. using TokenInit() with the string &quot;AA, BBB&quot; but calling TokenNext() with &quot;CCCEE&quot; would give first &quot;CC&quot; and then &quot;EE&quot; (because &quot;CCCEE&quot; is not long enough).</div>

  <div>The WordRepl() takes the double characters of &lt;cDoubleCharacterSearchString&gt; one after the other and searches for them in &lt;cString&gt;.

If this happens, the double character sequence will be replaced with the corresponding double character sequence of &lt;cDoubleCharacterReplaceString&gt;. If &lt;cDoubleCharacterReplaceString&gt; is shorter than &lt;cDoubleCharacterSearchString&gt; the last double sequence of &lt;cDoubleCharacterReplaceString&gt; is used for the &quot;rest&quot; of &lt;cDoubleCharacterSearchString&gt;. Note that the last double character sequence in &quot;AABBC&quot; is &quot;BB&quot; in this context !! After the replacement the function restarts the search in &lt;cString&gt; BEHIND the replacement if the CSetAtMupa() switch is turned off, or BEHIND the first character of the replacement if the switch is turned on. (see examples for this !) One can omit the return value of this function by setting the CSetRef() to .T., but one must then pass &lt;cString&gt; by reference to get a result.</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>HBGD is basically a wrapper of Thomas Boutell's GD Library version 2.0.33. GD Library is a powerfull graphic library very usefull expecially under CGI environment.</div>
  <div>HBGD actually contains almost all GD functions, more a set of functions that extends original library and a set of classes that make easier to work with this library.</div>
  <div>Thomas Boutell's GD library actually supports these graphic formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, Animated GIF, GD, GD2, WBMP, XBM, XPM WBMP is Wireless Bitmap, not Windows Bitmap, and it is used for WAP. It is a B&amp;W bitmap.</div>
  <div>HBGD actually supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, GD, WBMP The other Animated GIF, GD2, XBM and XPM are not wrapped actually.</div>
  <div>Using this library you can, as a little example: - create an image in memory, true color or with a 256 colors palette; - load and save an image of above formats and convert it to another supported format; - draw dots, lines, dashed lines, polygons, rectangles, arcs, circles and ellipses; - fill with colors; - draw with brushes; - check a point or part or full image with a lot of query functions; - draw characters and words with internal fonts or using truetype fonts; - write strings on a base line or on a circle line and with any angle degree; - copy, resize and rotate part or full image;</div>
  <div>and, over this, some functions to clone, crop, zoom, rotate outside and inside.</div>
  <div>The prefix for all functions is GD (i.e. gdImageCreate() )</div>
  <div>You can use directly all API functions or TGD class.</div>
  <div>NOTE: Not all functions are wrapped.</div>

  <div>gdImageCreateFromWBmp() creates a WBmp image from a file or a handle or another image in memory.</div>
  <div>You can use one of 3 syntax:</div>
  <div>pImage := gdImageCreateFromWBmp( &quot;myimage.wbmp&quot; )</div>
  <div>or</div>
  <div>pImage := gdImageCreateFromWBmp( nFileHandle, nSize )</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>gdImageFilledArc() is used to draw a partial ellipse centered at the given point, with the specified width and height in pixels. The arc begins at the position in degrees specified by s and ends at the position specified by e. The arc is drawn in the color specified by the last argument. A circle can be drawn by beginning from 0 degrees and ending at 360 degrees, with width and height being equal. &lt;e&gt; must be greater than &lt;s&gt;. Values greater than 360 are interpreted modulo 360.</div>
  <div>To set the color index you have to use gdImageColorAllocate() function.</div>
  <div>Last parameter &lt;nStyle&gt; is a bitwise OR of the following possibilities: gdArc gdChord gdPie (synonym for gdArc) gdNoFill gdEdged</div>
  <div>gdArc and gdChord are mutually exclusive; gdChord just connects the starting and ending angles with a straight line, while gdArc produces a rounded edge. gdPie is a synonym for gdArc. gdNoFill indicates that the arc or chord should be outlined, not filled. gdEdged, used together with gdNoFill, indicates that the beginning and ending angles should be connected to the center; this is a good way to outline (rather than fill) a 'pie slice'</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>&quot;Antialiasing&quot; is a process by which jagged edges associated with line drawing can be reduced by blending the foreground color with an appropriate percentage of the background, depending on how much of the pixel in question is actually within the boundaries of the line being drawn. All line-drawing functions, such as gdImageLine(), gdImageOpenPolygon() and gdImagePolygon(), will draw antialiased lines if the special &quot;color&quot; gdAntiAliased constant is used when calling them.</div>
  <div>gdImageSetAntiAliased is used to specify the actual foreground color to be used when drawing antialiased lines. You may set any color to be the foreground, however as of version 2.0.12 an alpha channel component is not supported.</div>
  <div>Antialiased lines can be drawn on both truecolor and palette-based images. However, attempts to draw antialiased lines on highly complex palette-based backgrounds may not give satisfactory results, due to the limited number of colors available in the palette. Antialiased line-drawing on simple backgrounds should work well with palette-based images; otherwise create or fetch a truecolor image instead.</div>
  <div>You need not take any special action when you are finished with antialised line drawing.</div>
  <div>To set the color index you have to use gdImageColorAllocate() function.</div>

  <div>A &quot;brush&quot; is an image used to draw wide, shaped strokes in another image. Just as a paintbrush is not a single point, a brush image need not be a single pixel. Any gd image can be used as a brush, and by setting the transparent color index of the brush image with gdImageColorTransparent, a brush of any shape can be created. All line-drawing functions, such as gdImageLine, gdImageOpenPolygon and gdImagePolygon, will use the current brush if the special &quot;color&quot; gdBrushed or gdStyledBrushed is used when calling them. gdImageSetBrush is used to specify the brush to be used in a particular image. You can set any image to be the brush. If the brush image does not have the same color map as the first image, any colors missing from the first image will be allocated. If not enough colors can be allocated, the closest colors already available will be used. This allows arbitrary PNGs to be used as brush images. It also means, however, that you should not set a brush unless you will actually use it; if you set a rapid succession of different brush images, you can quickly fill your color map, and the results will not be optimal.</div>
  <div>You need not take any special action when you are finished with a brush. As for any other image. You must not use the color gdBrushed if the current brush has been destroyed; you can of course set a new brush to replace it.</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>It is often desirable to draw dashed lines, dotted lines, and other variations on a broken line. gdImageSetStyle can be used to set any desired series of colors, including a special color that leaves the background intact, to be repeated during the drawing of a line. To use gdImageSetStyle, create an array of integers and assign them the desired series of color values to be repeated. You can assign the special color value gdTransparent to indicate that the existing color should be left unchanged for that particular pixel (allowing a dashed line to be attractively drawn over an existing image).</div>
  <div>Then, to draw a line using the style, use the normal gdImageLine function with the special color value gdStyled.</div>
  <div>The style array is copied when you set the style, so you need not be concerned with keeping the array around indefinitely. This should not break existing code that assumes styles are not copied.</div>
  <div>You can also combine styles and brushes to draw the brush image at intervals instead of in a continuous stroke. When creating a style for use with a brush, the style values are interpreted differently: zero (0) indicates pixels at which the brush should not be drawn, while one (1) indicates pixels at which the brush should be drawn. To draw a styled, brushed line, you must use the special color value gdStyledBrushed.</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>gt_NewFlag() is used to construct a bit flag string. The bit flag functions can be used for storing a large number of logical values in a small space.</div>
  <div>To create a bit flag string you need to pass gt_NewFlag() a value that is equal to or greater than the number of flags required (you may want to allow for future expansion). Each character in the string returned from gt_NewFlag() will hold 8 logical values.</div>

That gives DOS an opportunity to deal with any redirections, and since you pass the device name as a parameter, you can test any device, not just LPT1 (note that the function defaults to PRN if you fail to pass a valid parameter).</div>
  <div>The function also temporarily traps the DOS critical error handler so you don't get any nasty error messages if the device isn't ready.  It restores the old critical error handler before exiting.</div>
  <div>Note that although this function is mainly designed for testing printers, you can also check to see if a drive is ready.  Since DOS thinks the NUL device exists on every drive, you can pass a drive letter followed by NUL as a parameter.  If DOS is able to open the NUL device, then the drive is ready, otherwise the door is open or something else is wrong.</div>
  <div>The source code is written to adhere to Turbo Assembler's IDEAL mode. To use another assembler, you will need to rearrange the PROC and SEGMENT directives, and also the ENDP and ENDS directives (a very minor task).</div>

  <div>This function moves the record pointer to a specific record in the file in the currently selected text file workarea.  If the record number requested is greater than the number of records in the file, the record pointer will be positioned at the last record.</div>
  <div>Internally, the function operates differently depending on how you invoke it.  Passing a value for ^b&lt;nLine&gt;^n results in what is effectively a skip operation, which is fairly quick.  However if you pass 0 for ^b&lt;nLine&gt;^n, e.g. ft_FGoto( 0 ), the function internally goes to the top of the file, then skips down the required number of records.  Hence if your file is relatively large and the current record is a high number, you may see some delay as ft_FGoto( 0 ) skips through the file.</div>

<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>In text mode the mouse cursor can either be a software generated or the actual hardware cursor. This routine allows one choose between them. The software cursor is the default and its effect on the character it covers is determined by the screen mask and the cursor mask. Both of these masks are 16-bit values (which in Clipper are passed as standard numerical values). The 16-bit masks are arranged in a manner identical to the way information is stored for each character cell on the screen. The low order 8 bits represent the actual character displayed while the high order bits represent the display atributes such as blinking, intensity and forground and background colors. The mask is represented in the diagram below:</div>
  <div>Bit:     │15    │14      12│11       │10       8│7       0│ Function:│blink │background│intensity│foreground│character│</div>
  <div>Blinking and high intensity are on when the bit is 1. The background and foreground indicate which colors are used for each. The software mouse cursor uses these two values by taking the mask from the screen cell it is on and performing a logical AND on each bit with the screen mask value. The result is then logically XOR'ed with the cursor mask value. Thus to keep the character the same but invert the foreground and background colors the following values would be used:</div>
  <div>Bit:     │15    │14      12│11       │10       8│7       0│ Function:│blink │background│intensity│foreground│character│ screen:  │  0   │   111    │    0    │   111    │11111111 │ =30719 cursor:  │  0   │   111    │    0    │   111    │00000000 │ =30464</div>
  <div>The hardware cursor is the text cursor provided by the video board. One specifies the range of scan lines which are on using &lt;nScrMask&gt; and &lt;nCrsMask&gt;. The range of values is dependant upon the type of monitor. The first scan line is 0.</div>

  <div>NOTE: These values are NOT restored after resetting the mouse driver/ hardware. A well behaved application should reset them to the original value upon exiting.</div>
  <div>NOTE: The above description is counter to all of the documentation I have available. However, it does not work the way it is documented with Microsoft drivers versions 6.16, 6.24, 7.04 and 8.20. The above movement values are documented to be the number of mickeys per 8 pixels and the double speed value as the number mickeys per second required to double the speed. Each of these values should range from 1 to 32000 but the driver forces a maximum of 100. Also the documentation states that resetting the mouse will reset these values. This is not the case.</div>

  <div>This function is similar to the KEYBOARD command, with a few exceptions. First, this function does not clear the keyboard buffer before inserting the keystroke.  In addition, since it uses the Inkey() value, you can stuff any key, including function keys, into the keyboard buffer. However, this also means that unlike the KEYBOARD command, you can only stuff one keystroke at a time.</div>
  <div>You can easily create a User-Defined Command that makes this function even more like the KEYBOARD command.  For example,</div>
  <div>#xcommand KEYSTROKE &lt;key&gt; =&gt; ft_PutKey( &lt;key&gt; )</div>
  <div>will create a command called KEYSTROKE that could be used as a companion command to KEYBOARD.  The only difference is that it would insert a single keystroke instead of a string.</div>
  <div>Be aware that this function makes use of Clipper's internal event handler.  If you don't like using internals, then don't use this function, you sniveling coward.</div>
  <div>This function is written to adhere to Turbo Assembler's IDEAL mode. To use another assembler, rearrange the SEGMENT and PROC directives and make any other necessary changes to the source code.</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>ft_ScanCode() enables you to distinguish the different scancodes of similar keys (such as Grey minus versus regular minus), thus increasing the number of keys your input routine can recognize.</div>
  <div>It works like Inkey(), in that it waits for a key to be pressed. The scan code consists of two bytes, which are returned as a two-character string.</div>
  <div>For example, calling ft_ScanCode() and pressing the Grey-minus key will return a two character string:</div>
  <div>hb_BChar( 45 ) + hb_BChar( 74 )</div>
  <div>LastKey() is not updated by ft_ScanCode(), so don't try to test LastKey() to see what was pressed during an ft_ScanCode() call.  Simply assign the return value to a variable and test that (see the test driver below).</div>

  <div>ft_NWSemLock() uses the Nanforum Toolkit's NetWare Semaphore API functions in order to provide a general purpose &quot;lock&quot; you can use in a NetWare environment.</div>

  <div>The point of semaphores is that you don't care how many users are using the resource; you merely wait on a semaphore until the resource becomes available or you give up.  When you're done, you signal it and off you go.</div>
  <div>Back to the open count.  ft_NWSemLock() opens the semaphore as named in &lt;cSemaphore&gt;.  After it is opened, the open count is checked.  If it is anything other than 1, that means someone else has it (or you failed in your open) so the semaphore is closed and the &quot;lock&quot; is refused.  If the value is 1, then your app is that 1 station so the &quot;lock&quot; is granted.</div>

<div class="d-it">
  <div>A semaphore is simply a label that indirectly controls network activity.  There is a semaphore name, which can be up to 127 characters, and an associated value, which can range from 0 to 127.</div>
  <div>A semaphore can be used for many things, but is most often used to limit the number of users in an application, and to control access to a network resource.</div>
  <div>A semaphore essentially allows you to place locks on resources other than files.</div>
  <div>An application begins the process by calling ft_NWSemOpen(). If the semaphore doesn't exist, NetWare will create it. ft_NWSemOpen() returns a handle that is used in other semaphore calls.</div>
  <div>Applications use ft_NWSemWait() to wait for a semaphore to become available.  ft_NWSemWait() decrements the semaphore's value by 1.  If the value &gt; 0, then the application should be allowed to access the semaphore's resource.  If the value goes negative, then the application is placed in a queue. How long your app is in the queue is determined by how you set the timeout parameter.  If you can't get the resource in the time you allot, you're let out of the queue and the value increments by 1 again.</div>
  <div>When an application finishes with a semaphore, it should call ft_NWSemSig() to increment the value, and then ft_NWSemClose() to close the semaphore.  When the semaphore's open count goes to 0, NetWare deletes it.</div>
  <div>ft_NWSemEx() can be used to examine the value and open count without affecting them.</div>
  <div>For an interesting discussion on the operating system aspects of semaphores, check &quot;Operating Systems Design and Implementation&quot; by A. Tanenbaum, page 60.  For more details on NetWare's semaphore facilities, refer to Charles Rose's &quot;Programmer's Guide to NetWare&quot;.  The &quot;Programmer's Guide&quot; will make an excellent companion guide to the source code for all NetWare functions in the Nanforum Toolkit.</div>

  <div>ft_Proper() uses a brute-force algorithm to convert a string to propername case.  First, it capitalizes the first letter of all words starting after a blank, dash, or apostrophe.

<h4>ADS Overview</h4>
<div class="d-ol">
  <div>Advantage Database Server RDD</div>
</div>
<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>rddads is an RDD for the Advantage Database Server, an xBase data server by Extended Systems &lt;www.advantagedatabase.com&gt;. The RDD was written by Alexander Kresin &lt;alex@belacy.belgorod.su&gt; Additional code and documentation was added by Brian Hays &lt;bhays@abacuslaw.com&gt;.</div>
  <div>Your Harbour application can access a remote database server for a true client/server architecture, or it can use the &quot;local server&quot; for stand-alone or even small network installations.</div>
  <div>For using this RDD you need to have all required dynamic libraries installed on your system.</div>
  <div>For building executables don't forget to include rddads.hbc in your hbmk2 project.</div>
  <div>You also need to include in your prg file following lines:</div>
  <div>REQUEST ADS rddRegister( &quot;ADS&quot;, 1 ) rddSetDefault( &quot;ADS&quot; )</div>
  <div>By default rddads is tuned for remote server and cdx indexes. To change this you may use these commands defined in ads.ch:</div>
  <div>SET SERVER LOCAL SET SERVER REMOTE</div>
  <div>SET FILETYPE TO NTX SET FILETYPE TO ADT SET FILETYPE TO CDX</div>
  <div>or functions AdsSetServerType(), AdsSetFileType(). See the header file ads.ch for details.</div>
  <div>Note that the default local server is useable for file sharing on a small network.  The default DLL is limited to 5 users, but an unlimited version is available from Extended Systems.</div>
  <div>MAX OPEN TABLES: The server (even local) has its own setting for Max Tables allowed open.  For the Local Server, it can be set in adslocal.cfg.  The default is only 50! For the Windows Remote Servers, use the Configuration Utility, or increase the setting for the TABLES configuration value in the Advantage Database Server configuration registry key using the Registry Editor. For NetWare, edit the configuration file ads.cfg.</div>
  <div>See ace.hlp under adslocal.cfg, or the Advantage Error Guide for error 7005.</div>
  <div>SPEED AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES</div>
  <div>If you have sluggish browsers, one issue could be the scrollbar. If it's fast with the scrollbar disabled, the browse/scrolling logic may not be as optimized as it could be. Scrollbars should always use AdsGetRelKeyPos() and AdsSetRelKeyPos() instead of key counting functions.</div>
  <div>If filtered data seems slower than expected, check these things: First, optimization is not on by default, so at the top of the app call</div>
  <div>Set( _SET_OPTIMIZE, .T. )</div>
  <div>or its command equivalent.  rddads will use an AOF whenever dbSetFilter is called *if it can*.</div>
  <div>Second, make sure the filter is one ADS can understand. UDFs are out, as are references to public or private variables. It's also best to remove field aliases from the string. ADS cannot reference aliases for other related tables, so they're superfluous. You can call</div>
  <div>? AdsIsExprValid( cFilter )</div>
  <div>to check.  If this returns False, neither the Local Server nor the Remote Server can process it, so optimization will never occur (but the Harbour RDD will process the filtering locally by eval'ing the codeblock and testing each record). The only way to speed it up is to fix the filter so ADS understands it.</div>
  <div>You can also use dbOrderInfo(DBOI_OPTLEVEL) to see if the current filter is optimized or not. COMIX users can use:</div>
  <div>FUNCTION rlOptLevel()</div>
  <div>RETURN dbOrderInfo( DBOI_OPTLEVEL )</div>
  <div>This returns the Clipper/COMIX values (not ADS-defined values) because this is an RDD call, not just a wrapper to the ADS call, which uses different numbers).</div>
</div>
<div class="d-d">Compliance</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>Every attempt has been made to make the RDD compliant with the standard dbfcdx RDD at the .prg level. One important difference is the handling of structural indexes. ACE will <strong>always</strong> automatically open an index with the same name as the data file.  There is no way to turn this feature off.</div>
  <div>You can use the Set() function call as well as the equivalent commands for SET DEFAULT TO, DATEFORMAT, DELETE, and EPOCH. Harbour automatically makes the call to ADS to change its internal setting to match Harbour's.</div>
  <div>INDEXING and Progress Displays: Remote server does not support the EVAL/EVERY clauses. Remember, there is an external process doing the indexing that knows nothing of Harbour expressions or codeblocks. Even with Local Server it's the DLLs doing all the indexing. So to do progress meters you need to implement <strong>AdsRegCallback( bEval )</strong>. It lets you set a codeblock that is eval'ed every 2 seconds. A numeric value of the &quot;percent completed&quot; is passed to the codeblock by the ADS server.</div>
  <div class="d-t d-t1">
  <div> #include &quot;inkey.ch&quot;</div>
  <div> PROCEDURE Main()</div>
  <div>    ...</div>
  <div>    AdsRegCallback( {| nPercent | outputstuff( nPercent ) }  )</div>
  <div>    /* The above codeblock will be called approximately</div>
  <div>       every 2 seconds while indexing.</div>
  <div>       The codeblock can return .T. to abort. */</div>
  <div>    INDEX ON FIRST + LAST + LABEL1 + LABEL2 TAG First</div>
  <div>    AdsClrCallback()</div>
  <div>    RETURN</div>
  <div> STATIC FUNCTION outputstuff( nPercent )  /* The &quot;callback&quot; function */</div>
  <div>    ? &quot;output stuff&quot;, nPercent</div>
  <div>    RETURN hb_keyStd( Inkey() ) == K_ESC  /* If press ESC, returns .T. to abort. */</div>
</div>
  <div>For programmers who are already familiar with the ACE engine, Harbour's compatibility with dbfcdx means there are some differences between the rddads in Harbour and the parallel ACE documentation:</div>
  <div>1) In ACE, skipping backwards to BOF goes to the phantom record and sets the record number to 0.  In rddads, the  record pointer stays at the Top record and only the BOF flag is set to True.</div>
  <div>2) In rddads, a filter expression can be used that may not be valid on the server (because of references to public variables or User-Defined Functions). In these cases, all data will come back from the server but will be filtered by the application running on the client. These situations lose the benefits of having a data server and should be avoided, but they will function as they would in a Clipper program.</div>
  <div>One problem with this scenario is that index key counting functions that are supposed to give an accurate count respecting the filter (e.g. dbOrderInfo( DBOI_KEYCOUNT ) will return the values the Server knows about, so the counts may be inaccurate.</div>
  <div>3) When setting a relation, the expression must be one that can be evaluated by the Advantage Expression Engine.  UDFs will fail.</div>

  <div>An Advantage Optimized Filter (AOF) consists of a bitmap of the records in the database. If bit 5 is on, record 5 is considered a visible record. If bit 5 is off, record 5 is not visible. It does not &quot;pass the test&quot;. Initially, the bits are set by the Server according to a filter expression from SET FILTER TO or AdsSetAOF(). But by using AdsCustomizeAOF() you can add or remove records at will from the visible set.  This is useful for tagging records or for refining a result set after the data has been retrieved from the server.</div>
  <div>The maximum number of records that can be customized in a single call is 16, 383, so &lt;aRecNos&gt; must not be longer than this.</div>
  <div>Calls to AdsCustomizeAOF() must be made after an application has created a filter with a call to AdsSetAOF(). To create a completely empty record set (to which records can be added with calls to AdsCustomizeAOF()), use &quot;.F.&quot; as the filter expression given to AdsSetAOF().

  <div>WARNING: Always start with a FULLY optimized AOF! If an application must use a filter expression that is not fully optimized as the starting point for customization, the ADS_RESOLVE_IMMEDIATE option should be used with the call to AdsSetAOF(). Otherwise, the dynamic filter resolution that occurs on the server will automatically remove records that have been added through the AdsCustomizeAOF() calls. The filter expressions &quot;.T.&quot; and &quot;.F.&quot; both result in fully optimized AOFs regardless of available indexes.</div>

</div>
<div class="d-d">Description</div>
<div class="d-it">
  <div>ADS has its own limitations for the logical or string expressions used in indexes, filters, scopes, etc. Unlike internal RDDs like DBFNTX, the server is independent of the applications code, so it cannot understand references to PUBLIC variables or User-Defined Functions (UDFs). (See ace.hlp under Advantage Expression Engine for a list of functions allowed by ADS.) Call AdsIsExprValid() to determine if the server can process the expression.</div>
  <div>For illustration, consider filter expressions. Since Harbour attempts to be as compatible with Clipper as possible, you CAN set a filter that ADS DOES NOT understand, but the filtering will be done by the RDD layer itself and ADS will be unaware of the filter setting. This means more data will be sent &quot;across the wire&quot; from the server to the client, and the client (in rddads) will be doing the processing. Since the value of a database server is to have more processing done by the server itself to reduce network traffic, it is better to only use filter expressions ADS can understand.</div>

  <div>See ace.hlp for full details about the Advantage Database Server. The Advantage Database Server has a fast Proprietary locking mode that is more efficient than traditional network locking. It is only available when using the remote server (not the local server).</div>
  <div>If a file is opened in the proprietary mode, other applications cannot open it in a &quot;write&quot; mode. So if non-Advantage applications need concurrent access to the data files, use the Compatibility locking mode by calling AdsLocking( .F. ).</div>
  <div>AdsLocking() is a Get/Set function for the locking mode. It affects files at the time they are opened. So when a data file is opened, the current setting is used for that file until it is closed.

<div class="d-it">
  <div>AdsTestRecLocks() is a Get/Set function for a &quot;record lock checking&quot; mode. ADS has Implicit Record locking that can mask programming errors. Implicit locking can occur the first time a value is written to a field with no lock in effect. The lock can potentially remain in effect indefinitely if the record pointer is not moved, causing bugs later in program execution that are hard to find. In Harbour internal RDDs, a runtime error occurs if an attempt is made to write to a shared file without a proper lock.</div>
  <div>AdsTestRecLocks( .T. ) will turn on a debugging mode to mimic this behavior and throw an error instead of allowing an implicit lock. Each time a field is set, we see if the file is open exclusively or locked, and whether the record has been explicitly locked already. If not, we throw an error so the developer can catch the missing lock condition. For performance reasons, Release code should leave this OFF. Although the call to AdsIsRecordLocked() is documented as a client call, not a server request, and should be fast, it will be called for EACH FIELD as it is assigned a value.</div>
