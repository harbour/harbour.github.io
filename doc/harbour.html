Welcome to Harbour ==================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Clipper is a trademark of Computer Associates and will often be
referred to as CA-Cl*pper within Harbour documents.  Regardless of
this variant, Clipper is recognized as Computer Associates' trademark.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Harbour is a free software compiler for the xBase superset language
often referred to as Clipper (the language that is implemented by the
compiler Clipper). The goal of the Harbour project is to produce a
cross platform CA-Cl*pper compatible compiler.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The Harbour web site is at &lt;URL:http://harbour-project.org/&gt;. If you
have any problems with this copy of Harbour please visit our web site
and ensure that you are using the latest release.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
If you have any questions about Harbour please be sure to read the
FAQ &lt;URL:http://harbour-project.org/faq/&gt;. Also, please be sure to
read the documentation that comes with Harbour, you should find it in
the same directory in which you found this file.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
If you are reading this file as part of a source distribution of
harbour you probably want to start by reading dirstruc.txt because
this is your map to the harbour source directories.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Harbour is a superset of Clipper and is backwards compatible with
nearly 100% of all Clipper 5.2x or 5.3 code. Most Clipper S'87 code
will also compile and run fine, but may require some modifications to
run well.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991 Copyright (C) 1989,
1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place - Suite 330,
Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Preamble
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License
is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it
to your programs, too.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or vmodify the software.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;b&gt;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&lt;/b&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.)
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published
by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;b&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/b&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended

</div>
<div class="itemtext">
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

</div>
<div class="itemtext">
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published
by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software

</div>
<div class="itemtext">
===================================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
There is no one single license that applies to the Harbour Project
contrib files. Some files use the Harbour Project Compiler license.
Some files use the Harbour Project Library license. Some files use
the old Harbour Project Library license (and in one case, just one
function in a file that otherwise uses the Harbour Project Library
license uses the old license - this is the DateTime() function in the
file  contrib\libmisc\dates2.c).  Some files may even use other types
of free software or open source  software licenses. Some files have
been donated to the public domain. If you use any of the contrib
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
files, you need to investigate the license that applies to each file.

&lt;b&gt;Handling of undeclared variables  &lt;/b&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
================================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
When a value is assigned to an undeclared variable and the '-v'
command line option is not used, then the CA-Cl*pper compiler assumes
that the variable is a PRIVATE or a PUBLIC variable and generates
POPM (pop memvar) opcode.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
When the value of an undeclared variable is accessed and the '-v'
command line option is not used, the CA-Cl*pper compiler generates
PUSHV (push variable) opcode that determines the type of variable at
runtime. If a field with the requested name exists in the current
workarea then its value is used. If there is no field then a PRIVATE
or a PUBLIC variable is used (if exists).
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The Harbour compiler generates an opcode to determine the type of
variable at runtime (POPVARIABLE or PUSHVARIABLE) in both cases
(assignment and access).
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The difference can be checked by the following code:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;fixed&gt; PROCEDURE Main()
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
PRIVATE myname
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">

&lt;b&gt;Passing an undeclared variable by the reference &lt;/b&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
===============================================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The CA-Cl*pper compiler uses the special opcode PUSHP to pass a
reference to an undeclared variable ( '@' operator ). The type of
passed variable is checked at runtime (field or memvar). However,
field variables cannot be passed by reference. This means that
CA-Cl*pper checks the memvar variable only and doesn't look for a
field. This is the reason why the Harbour compiler uses the usual
PUSHMEMVARREF opcode in such cases. Notice that the runtime behavior
is the same in CA-Cl*pper and in Harbour - only the generated opcodes
are different.

<div class="itemtext">
Handling of object messages
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
===========================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The HARBOUR_STRICT_CLIPPER_COMPATIBILITY setting determines
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
the way chained send messages are handled.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
For example, the following code:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
a:b( COUNT() ):c += 1
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
will be handled as:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
a:b( COUNT() ):c := a:b( COUNT() ):c + 1
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
in strict CA-Cl*pper compatibility mode and
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
temp := a:b( COUNT() ), temp:c += 1
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
in non-strict mode.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
In practice, CA-Cl*pper will call the COUNT() function two times: the
first time before addition and the second one after addition. In
Harbour, COUNT() will be called only once, before addition.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The Harbour (non-strict) method is:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
1) faster 2) it guarantees that the same instance variable of the
same object will be changed

<div class="itemtext">
&lt;b&gt;Initialization of static variables      &lt;/b&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
==================================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
There is a difference in the initialization of static variables that
are initialized with a codeblock that refers to a local variable. For
example:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;fixed&gt; PROCEDURE TEST() LOCAL MyLocalVar STATIC MyStaticVar := {||
MyLocalVar }
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
MyLocalVar :=0 ? EVAL( MyStaticVar )
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
RETURN &lt;/fixed&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The above code compiles fine in CA-Cl*pper, but it generates a
runtime error Error/BASE 1132 Bound error: array access Called form
(b)STATICS$(0)
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
In Harbour this code generates a compile time error: Error E0009
Illegal variable (b) initializer: 'MyLocalVar'
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Both CA-Cl*pper and Harbour are handling all local variables used in
a codeblock in a special way: they are detached from the local stack
of function/procedure where they are declared. This allows access to
these variables after the exit from a function/procedure. However,
all static variables are initialized in a separate procedure
('STATICS$' in CA-Cl*pper and '(_INITSTATICS)' in Harbour) before the
main procedure and before all INIT procedures. The local variables
don't exist on the eval stack when static variables are initialized,
so they cannot be detached.

&lt;b&gt;Passing an undeclared variable by the reference &lt;/b&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
===============================================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The CA-Cl*pper compiler uses the special opcode PUSHP to pass a
reference to an undeclared variable ( '@' operator ). The type of
passed variable is checked at runtime (field or memvar). However,
field variables cannot be passed by reference. This means that
CA-Cl*pper checks the memvar variable only and doesn't look for a
field. This is the reason why the Harbour compiler uses the usual
PUSHMEMVARREF opcode in such cases. Notice that the runtime behavior
is the same in CA-Cl*pper and in Harbour - only the generated opcodes
are different.

Handling of object messages
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
===========================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The HARBOUR_STRICT_CLIPPER_COMPATIBILITY setting determines
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
the way chained send messages are handled.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
For example, the following code:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
a:b( COUNT() ):c += 1
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
will be handled as:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
a:b( COUNT() ):c := a:b( COUNT() ):c + 1
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
in strict CA-Cl*pper compatibility mode and
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
temp := a:b( COUNT() ), temp:c += 1
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
in non-strict mode.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
In practice, CA-Cl*pper will call the COUNT() function two times: the
first time before addition and the second one after addition. In
Harbour, COUNT() will be called only once, before addition.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The Harbour (non-strict) method is:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
1) faster 2) it guarantees that the same instance variable of the
same object will be changed
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">

<div class="itemtext">
&lt;b&gt;Initialization of static variables      &lt;/b&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
==================================
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
There is a difference in the initialization of static variables that
are initialized with a codeblock that refers to a local variable. For
example:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;fixed&gt; PROCEDURE TEST() LOCAL MyLocalVar STATIC MyStaticVar := {||
MyLocalVar }
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
MyLocalVar :=0 ? EVAL( MyStaticVar )
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
RETURN &lt;/fixed&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The above code compiles fine in CA-Cl*pper, but it generates a
runtime error Error/BASE 1132 Bound error: array access Called form
(b)STATICS$(0)
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
In Harbour this code generates a compile time error: Error E0009
Illegal variable (b) initializer: 'MyLocalVar'
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Both CA-Cl*pper and Harbour are handling all local variables used in
a codeblock in a special way: they are detached from the local stack
of function/procedure where they are declared. This allows access to
these variables after the exit from a function/procedure. However,
all static variables are initialized in a separate procedure
('STATICS$' in CA-Cl*pper and '(_INITSTATICS)' in Harbour) before the
main procedure and before all INIT procedures. The local variables
don't exist on the eval stack when static variables are initialized,
so they cannot be detached.

Compile-Time type checking

<div class="itemtext">
Strong Type Checking could also be described as &quot;Compile-Time Type
Checking&quot;.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
CA-Cl*pper generates a Run-Time Error (&quot;Type Mismatch&quot;) at an attempt
to perform some operations with the wrong type of Variable.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Examples:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
LOCAL Var1 := &quot;A&quot;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
? Var1 * 3 // Error here.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
@ Var1, 7 SAY 'Hello' // Error here.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
? SubStr( &quot;Hello&quot;, Var1 ) // Error here.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The above 3 lines would all result in Run-Time Error, because Var1 is
of type CHARACTER but the above lines used it as if it was of type
NUMERIC.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Using Strong Type Checking, or Compile-Time Type Checking, the above
problem would have been discovered and reported in COMPILE-TIME,
rather than waiting for the inevitable problem to be discovered when
we finally execute the program.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Strong Typed Languages allow the programmer to &quot;tell&quot; the compiler
(declare) what is the type of a each Variable, so that the Compiler
in return can warn the programmer, when ever such Declared (Strong
Typed) Variable, is used in a context which is incompatible with its
declared type.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
For instance, if we &quot;told&quot; the compiler that Var1 above is of type
CHARACTER (LOCAL Var1 AS CHARACTER) the Harbour Compiler could, in
return, warn us if we attempted to perform the calculation:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Var1 * 3
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
because the Compiler knows we can't perform a multiplication of a
Character. (we might allow it in some context, but this is beyond the
scope of this discussion). Similarly we would have been warned when
attempting to use Var1 as a Row Number ( @ Var1 ), or as the 2nd
operand of the SubStr() function SubStr( &quot;Hello&quot;, Var1) ), because
the Compiler knows that these operations require a NUMERIC rather
than CHARACTER type.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The above may save us lots of time, by pointing a problem, we can not
escape, since such code will never perform correctly once executed.
So rather than wait to the testing cycle, for such problems to be
discovered, (and some times even later, after we may have distributed
our applications) instead we may know of such problems as soon as we
type HARBOUR ProgName -w3
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Harbour also offers a hybrid mode, where it can report such type
mismatch problems, even without requiring the programmer to declare
the type of variables. This feature, is referred to as Adaptive Type
Checking. The programmer is not required to make any changes in his
code to take advantage of this feature. All of the above 3 errors
would have been reported just as effectively as if the programmer
Strong Typed (declared) Var1. Harbour would have been able to report
such problems at compile time because the assignment Var1 := &quot;A&quot;
implied that Var1 is of type CHARACTER,until it will be assigned
another value. Therefore Harbour will &quot;remember&quot; that Var1 &quot;adapted&quot;
type CHARACTER, and thus the subsequent multiplication Var1 * 3, will
be reported as an error, as soon as you attempt to compile such code.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The nice aspect of this hybrid mode, is that unlike Strong Typed
Variables,you don't have to declare the type, so no code changes are
need, the Type instead is assumed by implication (type of the
assigned value). The other benefit, is that it is completely OK to
assign a new value of different type, any time, to such undeclared
(variant) variable. As soon as we assign a new type, the Compiler
will than protect us from using the Variable in an incompatible
context, since the variable &quot;adapted&quot; this type as soon as we
assigned a value which implies a type.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
While Adapted Type Checking may be fairly effective in reporting many
common mistakes, to take full benefits of such Compile-Time checking,
it is recommended to do declare the Type of Variables, when ever
possible.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The Harbour Strong Type features, also allows the declaration of the
expected parameters (including optionals) of User Defined Functions,
as well as their return Type. Similarly, you may declare the Type of
any Class Variables, Methods, and Methods Parameters.

Harbour is a free implementation of an xBase language compiler. It is
designed to be source code compatible with the CA-Cl*pper(r) compiler.
That means that if you've got some code that would compile using
CA-Cl*pper(r) then it should compile under Harbour. The

Harbour is a free implementation of an xBase language compiler. It is
designed to be source code compatible with the CA-Cl*pper(r) compiler.
That means that if you've got some code that would compile using
CA-Cl*pper(r) then it should compile under Harbour. The
Harbour-Project web page is:

</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Status and other information is always available from the web site.
There is a Harbour mailing list. Harbour is still at a very early
stage of development, so the mailing list is very much a Developers
only list, although every body is welcome to join in the discussions.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
We would like you to join the Harbour development team. If you are
interested you may suscribe to our mailing list and start
contributing to this free public project.

</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Please feel free to report all questions, ideas, suggestions, fixes,
code, etc. you may need and want. With the help of all of you, the
Harbour compiler and runtime libraries will become a reality very
soon.

<h4>
The Garbage Collector
</h4>
</div>
<div class="oneliner">
Readme for Harbour Garbage Collect Feature
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtitle">Description</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The garbage collector uses the following logic: - first collect all
memory allocations that can cause garbage; - next scan all variables
if these memory blocks are still referenced.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Notice that only arrays, objects and codeblocks are collected because
these are the only datatypes that can cause self-references (a[1]:=a)
or circular references (a[1]:=b; b[1]:=c; c[1]:=a) that cannot be
properly deallocated by simple reference counting.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Since all variables in harbour are stored inside some available
tables (the eval stack, memvars table and array of static variables)
then checking if the reference is still alive is quite easy and
doesn't require any special treatment during memory allocation.
Additionaly the garbage collector is scanning some internal data used
by harbour objects implementation that also stores some values that
can contain memory references. These data are used to initialize
class instance variables and are stored in class shared variables.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
In special cases when the value of a harbour variable is stored
internally in some static area (at C or assembler level), the garbage
collector will be not able to scan such values since it doesn't know
their location. This could cause some memory blocks to be released
prematurely. To prevent the premature deallocation of such memory
blocks the static data have to store a pointer to the value created
with hb_itemNew() function. Example:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
static HB_ITEM s_item; // this item can be released by the GC
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
static PHB_ITEM pItem; // this item will be maintained correctly
pItem = hb_itemNew( hb_param(1, IT_BLOCK) );
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
However, scanning of all variables can be a time consuming operation.
It requires that all allocated arrays have to be traversed through
all their elements to find more arrays. Also all codeblocks are
scanned for detached local variables they are referencing. For this
reason, looking for unreferenced memory blocks is performed during
the idle states.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The idle state is a state when there is no real application code
executed. For example, the user code is stopped for 0.1 of a second
during INKEY(0.1) - Harbour is checking the keyboard only during this
time. It leaves however quite enough time for many other background
tasks. One such background task can be looking for unreferenced
memory blocks.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Allocating memory -----------------
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The garbage collector collects memory blocks allocated with
hb_gcAlloc() function calls. Memory allocated by hb_gcAlloc() should
be released with hb_gcFree() function.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The garbage collecting ----------------------
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
During scanning of unreferenced memory the GC is using a mark &amp; sweep
algorithm. This is done in three steps:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
1) mark all memory blocks allocated by the GC with unused flag;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
2) sweep (scan) all known places and clear unused flag for memory
blocks that are referenced there;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
3) finalize collecting by deallocation of all memory blocks that are
still marked as unused and that are not locked.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
To speed things up, the mark step is simplified by swapping the
meaning of the unused flag. After deallocation of unused blocks all
still alive memory blocks are marked with the same 'used' flag so we
can reverse the meaning of this flag to 'unused' state in the next
collecting. All new or unlocked memory blocks are automatically
marked as 'unused' using the current flag, which assures that all
memory blocks are marked with the same flag before the sweep step
will start. See hb_gcCollectAll()  and hb_gcItemRef()
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Calling the garbage collector from harbour code
-----------------------------------------------
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The garbage collector can be called directly from the harbour code.
This is usefull in situations where there is no idle states available
or the application is working in the loop with no user interaction
and there is many memory allocations. See HB_GCALL() for explanation
of how to call this function from your harbour code.

when a server is present on two networks, and the service is to be
available only in one of them. Also, the same port on other addresses
is left free to be used, so you can have different server programs
running for different networks but managing the same service. For

Their are two components that can make up &lt;cTemplate&gt; : a function
string and a template string. Function strings are those functions
that globally tell what the format of &lt;xExpression&gt; should be. These
functions are represented by a single character precede by the @
symbol.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
There are a couple of rules to follow when using function strings and
template strings:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
- First, a single space must fall between the function template
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
and the template string if they are used in conjunction with one
another.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
- Second, if both components make up the value of &lt;cTemplate&gt;, the
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
function string must precede the template string. Otherwise, the
function string may appear with out the template string and vice
versa.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
The table below shows the possible function strings available with
the TRANSFORM() function.

F1 is scan code 59, so if you just press F1, you get key code 315,

<div class="itemtext">
CLASS creates a class from which you can create objects. The CLASS
command begins the class specification, in which the DATA elements
(also known as instance variables) and METHODS of the class are named.
The following scoping commands may also appear. They control the
default scope of DATA and METHOD commands that follow them.

<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
EXPORTED: VISIBLE: HIDDEN: PROTECTED:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;/fixed&gt; The class specification ends with the END CLASS command.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Classes can inherit from multiple &lt;SuperClasses&gt;, and the chain of
inheritance can extend to many levels.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
A program uses a Class by calling the Class Constructor, usually the
New() method, to create an object. That object is usually assigned to
a variable, which is used to access the DATA elements and methods.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Harbour's OOP syntax and implementation supports Scoping (Protect,
Hidden and Readonly) and Delegating, and is largely compatible with
Class(y)(tm), TopClass(tm) and Visual Objects(tm).

<div class="itemtitle">Description</div>
<div class="itemtext">
CLASS creates a class from which you can create objects. The CLASS
command begins the class specification, in which the DATA elements
(also known as instance variables) and METHODS of the class are named.
The following scoping commands may also appear. They control the
default scope of DATA and METHOD commands that follow them.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;fixed&gt;
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
EXPORTED: VISIBLE: HIDDEN: PROTECTED:
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
&lt;/fixed&gt; The class specification ends with the END CLASS command.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Classes can inherit from multiple &lt;SuperClasses&gt;, and the chain of
inheritance can extend to many levels.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
A program uses a Class by calling the Class Constructor, usually the
New() method, to create an object. That object is usually assigned to
a variable, which is used to access the DATA elements and methods.
<br />
</div>
<div class="itemtext">
Harbour's OOP syntax and implementation supports Scoping (Protect,
Hidden and Readonly) and Delegating, and is largely compatible with
Class(y)(tm), TopClass(tm) and Visual Objects(tm).

following) with an optional alias identifier as &lt;cDatabase&gt; for each.
This command allow  Harbour to resolve any reference to a field
specified in the field list by viewing it as a field when it is not
referenced by an alias. If a field is not listed in this list and it
is not  explicity tagged with an alias indentifier, it may be viewed
as a memory variable, which may cause run-time errors. This command
has no effect on memory variables or on field reference buried within
a macro expression.

The Set Key Command function is translated to the SetKey() function
witch returns the current code-block assigned to a key when called
with only the key value.  If the action block (and optionally the
condition block) are passed, the current block is returned, and the
new code block and condition block are stored. A group of keys may be
assigned the same code block/condition block by using an array of key
values in place on the first parameter.

SET KEY K_F10 TO bOldF10
... // some other processing
bBlock := SetKey( K_SPACE )
IF bBlock != NIL ...
// make F10 exit current get, but only if in a get - ignores other
// wait-states such as menus, achoices, etc...

Unknown 'COMPLIANCE' code: 'SET KEY is mostly CA-Cl*pper compliant.
The only difference is the addition of the condition code-block
parameter, allowing set-keys to be conditionally turned off or on. 
This condition-block cannot be returned once set - see SetKeyGet()'
