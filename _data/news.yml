  title: New logo and further website refresh
  text: The logo received a refresh, dropping the "Hb" characters, making
    it fit in a square shape and refreshed, fewer colors. The website evolved
    further as well, with brighter and more modern look, larger fonts,
    responsive design and a new Donate button. A visual overview of the
    website redesign steps

  title: Website refresh
  text: Continuing with the refactor, the site is now fully vector-based,
    sources have been cleaned up and further minimized, the look refreshed.
    The crew page and code examples are now automatically generated, thus
    much easier to update. Several pages have been converted to Markdown.
    Source size is now 64 kB (was 624 kB). Also added en edit button to
    each page.

  title: Website refactor
  text: Website refactored to use Jekyll, use pure HTML5, drop table based
    layout, drop JavaScript for a CSS menu, remove anything unused, fix things
    broken, use vector images instead of bitmaps where possible, deduplicate
    markup and content. This means 7.5x size reduction of page sources.<br>
    Content and design remained the same, but much easier to update now.
