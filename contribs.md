# Harbour contrib packages

Contribs are libraries or tools, which are independent from the language core,
but bundled with the main Harbour distribution. These components are part of
the Harbour source package.

Common to all contribs is that they are open/free software, but please note
that [licensing terms]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms{{ site.ilink_suffix }}) may
vary for each contrib.

See respective authors inside the [source code](https://github.com/{{ site.repo_slug }}/tree/{{ site.repo_branch }}/contrib).
